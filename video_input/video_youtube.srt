1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,430
so it's not none of this material really

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,680
would be from the this two books that we

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,050
just came out the stack and dispute plan

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,760
both of which were partially put

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,619
together in the seminars that we did

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,380
here and so this would be stuff that's

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:23,570
going into the next book which doesn't

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,130
have a title yet it has to do with

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,540
issues of design of philosophy and

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,919
artificial intelligence it's a

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,630
particular sort of take on artificial

12
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,480
intelligence not as something that

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:36,040
exists in a kind of abstracted form of

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,570
symbolic logic that a realm of pure mind

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,460
mathematics but rather something that

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,930
exists only in this sense of which it's

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,640
embodied and instantiated or

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,170
materialized in particular kinds of

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,440
waves and how it is that those that

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,300
instantiation is Co constitutive of

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,660
whatever form of intelligence we might

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,430
identify that might work there in this

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,750
way and so some of the things that we

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,340
will be working through I have listed

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:06,079
here but no no total promises for all of

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,640
this early go okay so first sort of

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,770
contextualize even some of the other

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,200
things that we've been talking about and

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:15,049
thinking of AI perhaps in relationship

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,850
to this previous book on the stack it

31
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:20,659
would certainly have to be understood as

32
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,939
a certain instantiation mr. version of

33
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,999
what we call planetary scale computation

34
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,200
in the way it works at different scales

35
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:29,329
energy and mineral source and grids

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,679
subterranean cloud infrastructure urban

37
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,630
software and service privatization the

38
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,310
interface is drawn by the augmentation

39
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,619
of the hand the eye are directly

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,770
resolved into objects users both over

41
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:44,689
outlined by self quantification or and

42
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,149
also exploded into the arrival of

43
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,740
legions of sensors algorithms and BOTS

44
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,509
and so to a certain extent we're talking

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,670
that AI that it exists at this level of

46
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,200
the user within the stack model but not

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,929
only that really at these other five

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,579
layers as well so particularly in design

49
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,060
will sort of say we might sort of start

50
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:05,119
with the city as a kind of meaty area as

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,409
sort of a kind of medium level scale by

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,549
which we discover to work you should

53
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,080
have worked up and backwards from this

54
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,170
as well and so first of all some

55
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,990
preliminary definition so we're sort of

56
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,610
some possible misunderstandings out of

57
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,170
the way right away first of all we're

58
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,910
talking with cities in this way of

59
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,830
something this is a kind of first is a

60
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,760
provisional settlement organized around

61
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,910
some form of agricultural and provision

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,880
and that's its initial form of culinary

63
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,000
geoengineering in which we in which we

64
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,000
reside in - as a node on a horizon that

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,710
would orient mobile people and things as

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,150
they migrated in flow that is we're

67
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,920
looking at the city first is a sort of

68
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,050
encapsulating mega structure that would

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,820
hold things in place and second ISM

70
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,160
is a throughput point that would

71
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,959
accelerate or decelerate things as they

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,240
as they move through them and move

73
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,480
through the particular orientation of

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,610
the city's wayfinding interfaces and so

75
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,250
cities defined in this way with

76
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,620
perspectives mix drawn mixing from I

77
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,950
don't know public health planning supply

78
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,290
chain logistics so forth are an

79
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,950
infrastructure for living and nonliving

80
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,590
matter to consume itself and for some

81
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:17,040
forms of matter some forms in order to

82
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,910
achieve and hone something like sentient

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
intelligence and even sapient

84
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,720
intelligence in some circumstances we

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,690
all of which in turn and in various ways

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,830
work to remake the city in their own

87
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,480
image we might think about this simply

88
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,530
return to count and quantify things one

89
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,150
of the things we've been working on as a

90
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,040
deep address projects going for a while

91
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,870
looking at the theoretical addressable

92
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,030
space of ipv6 which is next-generation

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,940
internet addressing system works -

94
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,890
128-bit string the you know which we

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,300
never run out of ipv4 addresses this

96
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,890
much with the things that we're running

97
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,450
the address on out with the internet on

98
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,250
now which is a theoretical address a

99
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,040
16-bit string which is about three and a

100
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,739
half billion possible addresses we've

101
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,290
all been allocated the RIR so 128-bit

102
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,850
address strings sort of back with the

103
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,540
envelope calculation council work so it

104
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,120
works out to something like 10 to the 23

105
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,180
addresses per person it begs the

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,799
question of like insufficient the level

107
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,049
of the granularity by which something

108
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,750
like a ubiquitous computing might

109
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,889
actually operate far below and above the

110
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,900
kind of notes of mere anti-symmetric

111
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,639
thing that our conventional internet of

112
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,110
thing discourse works is so bad so we're

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,550
interested in this question of the how

114
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,199
it is that synthetic and augmented

115
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,169
intelligence might operate at the urban

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,849
scale at that level of granularity and

117
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,009
all the way on up not just the things

118
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:36,020
that appear to us in the scale in which

119
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,659
we're used to by dressing them and being

120
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,879
addressed by them also we'll say just

121
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:42,349
for purposes of this conjunction of of

122
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,139
some discussions of what we mean reject

123
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:48,050
made by artificial intelligence to

124
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,120
dissuade some misinterpretations we

125
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,400
would we define or would propose a

126
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,699
version of intelligence in this way to

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,189
find us as a system as a way that matter

128
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,009
organizes itself into some form of

129
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:03,740
durable complexity it's a special form

130
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,060
of that complexity being the city that

131
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,500
settled accumulation of material

132
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,770
intelligence both human and non-human

133
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,349
and so as AI becomes more sophisticated

134
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,110
what does it's its own design project

135
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:16,789
become what should it be until we see on

136
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,219
the one hand AI is a sort of wait

137
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,210
something to an animate matter and it'll

138
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,659
scale and also something that its

139
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,460
dissolved or the structured into into

140
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:27,680
matter various scales in various ways

141
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,620
none of which necessarily all add up to

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
the same thing and so we make some

143
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,490
distinctions then between robotics on

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,889
the one hand programmable matter on the

145
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,069
other hand culinary materialism on the

146
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:43,069
third hand tangible media on the fourth

147
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,020
hand so as to bring them together back

148
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,210
in in different sorts of ways in other

149
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,979
words I see AI not as something

150
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,719
something something might happen in the

151
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,060
future some sort of thing that happens

152
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,159
after some great messianic moment but is

153
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,759
something that we see all around us all

154
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:00,349
the time and in terms of in the form of

155
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,899
and in terms of a kind of synthetic

156
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:04,729
reason that we are always we are in the

157
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:07,669
process of designing and designating and

158
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,919
which it becomes to in its own way

159
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,949
contribute to the formulation of our own

160
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,729
designations of ourselves and of it in

161
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:18,349
turn we also see it in it what

162
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,919
philosophy of mind calls the other mind

163
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:23,419
problem how it is that we might

164
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,110
communicate and identify and be

165
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,199
identified by that

166
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,069
one with which we can only share very at

167
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,810
least very partial world just don't were

168
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:35,639
just not embodied in the world in the

169
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,500
same way we don't think the same white

170
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,460
so how those terms of those communicate

171
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,289
on which is sir

172
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,909
same sort of questions we might agree as

173
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,610
we've been talking in seminary my readin

174
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:46,439
lens Solaris or Clark's 2001 release

175
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,699
into other kinds of alien communication

176
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:53,310
and so we try to see AI not in terms of

177
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,849
how we think that we think that is as an

178
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,060
image of ourselves in this way as a kind

179
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:03,180
of virtual or artificial human cognition

180
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,520
only but as something that as a way in

181
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,210
which matter thinks and embodies another

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,300
spot in a larger shared continuum of

183
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,080
material intelligence of which our own

184
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,810
accomplishments of sapiens are a

185
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:20,789
particularly are one particular form

186
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,259
genre example right and so just situate

187
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,879
these than once more bringing these

188
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,710
together into something like a common

189
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,689
frame with you sort of but project them

190
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,190
in some way across the stack thesis

191
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,770
which proposes in its own way a

192
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,659
particular kind of design model for

193
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,360
political geography tuned to the

194
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,710
question at planetary scale computation

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,150
the ways in which is starting with the

196
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,919
technology working from the inside out

197
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,599
to the governance towards the questions

198
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,879
of sovereignty and silver and selling so

199
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,370
where we want to locate the AI where

200
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,620
locating a AI locates us in these

201
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,120
different scales is not all the same we

202
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,909
want to hold them apart in a certain

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,710
kind of way now to the design question

204
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:57,120
sort of quickly again to sort of at the

205
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,469
beginning was in disclaimers we're

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,300
talking about the rise and sort of

207
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,029
network platforms in a physical world

208
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,560
and services geared towards I mean

209
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,150
towards this we want to differentiate

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,770
this from a certain kind of conventional

211
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,360
smart cities discourse that would see

212
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,310
the rise of those in terms of just

213
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
prosaic forms of consumption and

214
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,099
marketing pedestrian flow optimization

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,139
so forth I'm not I hope talking about a

216
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:21,599
sort of hybrid of The Truman Show with

217
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,129
alpha v Lovelace Watson to smart control

218
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,719
in production variations this is not

219
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,819
really what

220
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,249
to me it's not about the way in which

221
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:31,669
these technologies might amplify or

222
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,870
optimize these kinds of toxic relations

223
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,599
to the world but the way in which that

224
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,789
they would crack open other other forms

225
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,800
of kinds of relationships so again to

226
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,659
jump right in we would ask then after

227
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,189
something like intelligence how is it

228
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,689
that the in this conjunction of

229
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,579
computation of the algorithmic

230
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:50,089
mechanisms and matter itself computation

231
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:52,490
becomes a kind of solvent of a

232
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,410
particular form of algorithmic reason in

233
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,779
various kinds of matter we take it for

234
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,110
example the computation was discovered

235
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:01,879
more than it was invented and that the

236
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,519
algorithmic generative processes are

237
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,279
that we might find are intrinsic to the

238
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,089
wider unfolding of the world and for

239
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,949
today's Meteor computational appliances

240
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,290
are nowhere near as sophisticated and

241
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:17,779
efficient as those that precede Homo

242
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,250
sapiens we take it the computation is

243
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:20,899
one of the ways that matter in whatever

244
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,579
form achieves at elegance to its

245
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,220
procedural abstraction that we may tap

246
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,870
in to wrangle on some kind of

247
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,410
provisional level one way or another and

248
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,629
as such sapiens brain tissue is one kind

249
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,819
of matter that has achieved intelligence

250
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,819
in certain ways both some of which both

251
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:40,189
clearly are and others are clearly not

252
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:43,699
quote computational in any conventional

253
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:45,350
sense at the larger scale we take it

254
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:47,420
that the solute that solution

255
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,370
dissolution of synthetic computation

256
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,759
software in other words into the urban

257
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:55,279
fabric provides for a landscape with

258
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,680
inorganic forms - sort of distributed

259
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,559
intelligence because it provides those

260
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,379
things with the capacity for themselves

261
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,480
for abstraction which I'll talk a bit

262
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,970
about in a moment that is we see

263
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,029
intelligence in this way as a form of

264
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,949
something that accomplishes abstraction

265
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,149
computation then is a form of

266
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:17,089
intelligent and computation then it's a

267
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,990
kind of mechanism of abstraction how

268
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,519
matter abstraction cells so this

269
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,000
perspective in principle should account

270
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,579
for two two related but different

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,529
understandings one would recognize as I

272
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,889
say that intelligence and knowledge for

273
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,760
that matter is always distributed among

274
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,860
multiple positions and the four

275
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,730
of life both similar and dissimilar to

276
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,900
one another that no single

277
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,320
neuroanatomical disposition as a

278
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,990
privileged monopoly on how to think

279
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,180
intelligently what might qualify as

280
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,390
general intelligence is not duty-bound

281
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,480
to species or phylum in its capacities

282
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,830
for abstraction we might say no ways of

283
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,740
thinking of in terms of the ability of

284
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,110
any organism however primitive to map

285
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,000
its own surroundings is this function of

286
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,530
abstraction particularly in relationship

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,290
to the basic terms of friend food or foe

288
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:16,080
this is a kind of primordial abstraction

289
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,810
from which we do not graduate so much as

290
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,970
we learn to develop into something like

291
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,370
a more formal kind of Reason in its

292
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,950
local human variations thinking though

293
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,170
from 9000 protozoan it's silly under

294
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,610
some figuring out what's on going on

295
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,280
around it this is a basic kind of

296
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,780
mapping is that it's the primordial form

297
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,110
of abstraction and in this way the

298
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,910
mapping function of abstraction is not

299
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,590
then through an early stage through

300
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,300
which things pass on their way to more

301
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,100
complex forms of intelligence it's

302
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,090
rather general principle of that

303
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,100
complexification as I say like the

304
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,710
protozoa cilia feeling about so what's

305
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,560
out there or like humans looking and

306
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,900
tasting and imagining patterns

307
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,580
today's AI or sometimes augmented by

308
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,560
various technologies machine cognition

309
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:07,190
sensation and vision that allowed them

310
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,290
to see and sense the world out there and

311
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,000
to abstract forms of mechanically

312
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,950
embodied intelligence both deliberately

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,130
programmed for them and emerging

314
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:23,100
unexpectedly so this sort of a sort of

315
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,380
emergent particular form of a certain

316
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,250
kind of distribution of the sensible if

317
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,810
you like shifting certain kinds of

318
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,610
interest from a jacquard from

319
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,780
merleau-ponty if you like back again I

320
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,070
want to sort of think of these really in

321
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,630
hopes for the rest of the talks or if I

322
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,480
discuss with you sort of these in terms

323
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,890
of three ways first a kind of thinking

324
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,390
first we'll discuss was no challenge of

325
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,010
conventional Turing test models

326
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,830
humanistic models have thought that

327
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,990
would that would

328
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,649
and measure them for their

329
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,120
epistemological and practical dangers

330
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,769
from the deep interest structure of

331
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,200
their effects what do we today gather

332
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,610
under the name of a I will shift not

333
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,890
only what counts is thinking but what

334
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,870
counts as architecture naming will will

335
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,670
try to evade the presumption that when

336
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,470
will identify and recognize the

337
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,149
threshold of an artificial intelligence

338
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,250
to the extent that it's recognizable is

339
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:14,079
similar to our own second skin

340
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,480
epidermal media synthetic skin and the

341
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,720
design convergence of natural sensation

342
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,430
and machine sensing for animal skins

343
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,079
like our own but also for urban skins

344
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,209
and surfaces and interfaces and

345
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,610
implications of this for what we may

346
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:31,029
have once called dwelling in per se and

347
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,940
Lashley machine vision camouflage the

348
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:39,810
inverse uncanny valley artificially

349
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:44,470
intelligent paranoia and apophenia first

350
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:48,010
to thinking no touring is you know mrs.

351
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,320
Alan Turing Turing as you know proposed

352
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,029
his test as a variation on the popular

353
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,120
parlor game the imitation game in which

354
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:58,240
two hidden contestants a woman player a

355
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,570
and a man player be tried to convince a

356
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,430
third player that he or she is a woman

357
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,630
by their written responses to leading

358
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,649
questions to win one of the players must

359
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,870
convincingly be who they really are

360
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:14,829
whereas the other must try to pass as

361
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,180
another gender entering seven 1950 which

362
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:19,420
were in the seminar matrix but what if a

363
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,800
computer took the place of player a so

364
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,880
he's really suggesting you know exist

365
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,170
waste not just that a computer would

366
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,520
take the place of a person to try to

367
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,570
suggest that they are in fact human but

368
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,720
that it would try to pretend to be a

369
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,270
woman he's with a more literal reading

370
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,620
would suggest now as we know the

371
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,589
mathematician Turing himself also had to

372
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,720
pass in his case is a straight man in a

373
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,310
society that criminalized homosexuality

374
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,589
and upon the discovery that he was not

375
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,100
what he appeared to be he was forced to

376
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,620
undergo horrific medical experiments

377
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,650
treatments

378
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,580
let's say known as chemical castration

379
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,020
and ultimately the physical and

380
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,130
emotional pain was too great and he'd

381
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,460
committed suicide

382
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,990
the episode being a grotesque tribute to

383
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,550
a man whose recent contribution to

384
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,190
defeating Hitler's military was still a

385
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,120
state secret

386
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,970
Turing should be said was only recently

387
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,950
given a posthumous pardon but tens of

388
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,880
thousands of other British men Centrum's

389
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:13,670
under similar laws today have not won

390
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,650
notes I think a kind of sour ironic

391
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,170
correspondence between asking an AI to

392
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,790
pass the test in order to qualify as

393
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,850
intelligent who passes a human

394
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,520
intelligence returns only to hide his

395
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,580
own animal sexuality and to pass as a

396
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,890
straight man the demands of both Bluffs

397
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,680
are unnecessary and profoundly unfair

398
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,870
and as for all passing the performances

399
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,790
success or failure reveals more about

400
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,980
the audience than about the performer in

401
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,080
other in other place in some fictions

402
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,320
policing the imitation game is a matter

403
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,240
of life and death the part of Ridley

404
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,580
Scott's film version of grand regime of

405
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Electric Sheep from Blade Runner the

406
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,630
philip k dick novel hinges on the

407
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,870
voight-komp empathy test which

408
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,700
differentiates humans from reference in

409
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,100
this narrative replicants are throttled

410
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,260
in two important ways first they expire

411
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,290
after just a few years and two they have

412
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,530
ostensibly a rather diminished capacity

413
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:14,960
for empathy Deckard the Harrison Ford

414
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,120
character must retire a group of rogue

415
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,000
replicants but first you must find them

416
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,540
and in this world Turing test thresholds

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,740
are weaponized lest replicants pass as

418
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,630
humans and trespass beyond their station

419
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,140
by the film's conclusion Deckard who

420
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,450
himself may or may not be a replicant

421
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:38,330
develops a certain empathy we might say

422
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,900
for the replicants own desire for quote

423
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,880
more life an arguably they - at least

424
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,830
the Roy batty Rutger Hauer kiss

425
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,220
character seems to have empathy for

426
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:53,930
Deckard's own dilemma his dilemma and

427
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:56,120
ours is that in order to enforce the gap

428
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,910
between the human and the eye i define

429
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,380
by empathy or lack thereof

430
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:06,000
Deckert must suppress the empathy that

431
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:07,860
supposedly makes him uniquely human by

432
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,080
forcing him to quash his own

433
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,240
identification with the replicants that

434
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,280
supposedly cannot have empathy in return

435
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,700
the principle of differentiation

436
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,530
requires its own violation in order to

437
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:24,300
maintain itself far better I think to

438
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,310
examine in terms of sort of thinking

439
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,920
about how the AI might perform in this

440
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,690
way to examine how identification and

441
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,050
identification the production of the

442
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,890
effect of empathy works from our side of

443
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,920
the conversation

444
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,980
this is Paro the baby's robot seal by

445
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,560
the way it's clearly much easier to make

446
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,630
a robot that a human believes to have

447
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,520
emotions and for which a human in turn

448
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,260
may have emotions positive or negative

449
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,350
than it is to make a robot that actually

450
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,900
has those emotions the human may feel

451
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,260
love or hate or comfort from the eye but

452
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,800
he or she is reading cues not detecting

453
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,440
feelings what seems like empathy is

454
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,440
really a one way projection mistaken for

455
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:12,620
recognition like the Turing test itself

456
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,450
and not based on any mutual solidarity

457
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:18,240
will the wish to define the very

458
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,000
existence of AI in relationship to its

459
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,190
ability to mimic how humans think that

460
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,330
humans think will this be looked back on

461
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,310
in some weird form of species perhaps it

462
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,590
may also that the legacy this also that

463
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:33,360
the this legacy the older models of AI

464
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,850
research sending sent this research

465
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,430
account disappointingly fruitless paths

466
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,260
hoping to recreate human minds from top

467
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,080
down as the basic structure and it just

468
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,150
doesn't work

469
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,290
Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig remind

470
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:52,080
us and they're essential AI textbook

471
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,500
biomorphic imitation is not generally

472
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,710
how we decide about complex technology

473
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:01,260
airplanes don't fly like birds and we

474
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,210
certainly don't try to convince try to

475
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,250
trick birds into thinking that airplanes

476
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,919
are birds in order to test whether these

477
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:13,690
planes really are flying machine

478
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:16,629
so why do we do this for AI today the

479
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,340
vast majority of real serious core AI

480
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:20,529
researchers not focus on the Turing test

481
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,409
is anything like a central criterion of

482
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:25,240
success other than H AI I are human

483
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:27,279
artificial touch interaction research as

484
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,889
the criterion of success yeah in a

485
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,860
general popular discourse about AI the

486
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:36,100
tests or versions of its insert the

487
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,379
anthropocentrism there uphold such still

488
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,269
such conceptual importance like the

489
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:42,639
animals who talk like teenagers in a

490
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,649
Disney movie other minds are conceivable

491
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:49,059
mostly by way of pure aisle

492
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:51,580
ventriloquism should a I arrive it will

493
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:54,850
not be human-like unless we insist that

494
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,159
it pretend to be so because one assumes

495
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,639
the idea that intelligence could be both

496
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,799
real and inhuman at the same time as

497
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,350
somehow morally or psychologically

498
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,909
intolerable instead of nurturing this

499
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,090
bigotry we move to better to allow that

500
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:13,330
in our universe thinking is a much more

501
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,759
diverse even alien phenomenon than our

502
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,220
own particular case thus the real

503
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,869
philosophical issues and lessons of AI

504
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,730
will have less to do with humans

505
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:24,399
teaching machines how to think than with

506
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,309
machines teaching humans a fuller and

507
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:33,840
truer range of what thinking is and can

508
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:35,980
be now in addition to the

509
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,389
demystification and expansion of

510
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,299
thinking in this way and the relocation

511
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:43,779
of human sapiens within this expanded

512
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,610
field the sensory media of synthetic

513
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,950
intelligence may also contribute to a

514
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,590
certain kind of undermining of certain

515
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,450
forms of a durable content sort of

516
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,960
distilled philosophical distinction

517
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,399
between thinking and sensing discussion

518
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,200
so I want to hone in a bit on the ways

519
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,899
in which that kind of cartographic

520
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,889
abstraction mapping what's out there can

521
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:08,470
in fact also be thermal related to skin

522
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:10,840
how it occupies it agitates skin's human

523
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,510
skins building skins any school and how

524
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,010
this does so officer for the purpose

525
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:19,170
mapping and so I touch briefly on these

526
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,510
extending what something like a skin

527
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,760
based media aperture sorry and epidermal

528
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,230
media can be almost keep with the skin

529
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,960
with humans photo we recognized that

530
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,000
wealth in the late 19th century cinema

531
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,240
and photography allowed for to be

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,670
possible to compose and to see sorts of

533
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,940
images we had never seen before

534
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,200
montage slow-motion double exposure and

535
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,860
so forth and the same goes the synthetic

536
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,500
and recorded sound or auditory senses

537
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,690
our largest sensory organ is our skin

538
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,580
and however quite obviously today we

539
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,740
have not developed nearly as diverse

540
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,960
forms of sophisticated forms of

541
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,030
artificial touch or tactility or feeling

542
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,020
for skin based media as we have for

543
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:03,210
vision and hearing clothing are you

544
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,940
least one way that we have leapfrog

545
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,790
genetic evolution to augment skin ie

546
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:13,620
faster faster than evolving fur or

547
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:15,390
blubber is to engineer scuba suits so

548
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,920
part of the research that working in one

549
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,960
practical research engaged with UC San

550
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,460
Diego with the Center for design geo

551
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,270
politics in collaboration with our

552
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,910
Department of nano engineering

553
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,830
bioengineering is some exploratory

554
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,960
research on how this or let's say the

555
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,200
presume space of difference between

556
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,140
natural selection on the one hand and

557
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,090
machine sensing on the other is alighted

558
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,400
by certain technologies that operate in

559
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,590
and on the skin and at the scale of our

560
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,500
dermal and epidermal somatosensory

561
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,030
system mechanoreceptors thermo receptors

562
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,000
and so forth and by this I don't mean

563
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,340
some kind of triple o word game by which

564
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,200
McLeish machines are bequeath with pan

565
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,540
psychic capacities for of intuition

566
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,700
effect rather I refer to real-deal

567
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,740
technologies by which biological and

568
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,930
non-biological physicochemical reactions

569
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,790
are literally interwoven in and at the

570
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:08,220
scale on the sense8 skin artificial

571
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:11,550
skins are also among one of the more

572
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,290
areas of design research more generally

573
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,200
in this way DARPA for example is long

574
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,480
funded research into advanced

575
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,490
prosthetics and currently one of the

576
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,230
research tracks

577
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,419
focuses on providing from a synthetic

578
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,220
tactile sensation

579
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:27,869
sort of virtual fingertips that might go

580
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,820
in the end of those prosthetics people

581
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,350
go actually wearing them to field use

582
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,960
them as a way to feel and to touch the

583
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,909
world and other kinds of dermal surfaces

584
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,330
of poor that would enable a corporeal

585
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:42,029
extensions for the wear and another as I

586
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,340
say in other labs near us when can find

587
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,619
varieties of epidermal micro electronics

588
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,690
that augment the living skins capacities

589
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,989
for sensing internal or extra internal

590
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,210
or external symmetry next order these

591
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:56,489
nanoscale chemistry cooks up inks that

592
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,289
react to the presence of ambient trace

593
00:23:56,489 --> 00:24:01,649
elements of whatever particles they're

594
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:04,379
tuned to react with and so designing

595
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,999
chemical sensitivity a core near the

596
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:08,100
atomic level in this case and the

597
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,679
registration of those as a transmissible

598
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,080
information with dermal and epidermal

599
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,299
microelectronics at larger scales we can

600
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,019
conceive really of a real immediate

601
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,269
ization of sense8 surfaces together

602
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,029
these technologies suggest something

603
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,950
like a skin based micro stack comprised

604
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,720
of biological and chemical and

605
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:31,109
mechanical sensing and processing in

606
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,539
various combinations as an emergent

607
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:35,940
formulation of wearable computing here

608
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:38,220
also including biochemical reactions it

609
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,869
blends as I say animal sensation machine

610
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,769
sensing into a kind of composite

611
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:46,019
surficial media there's platforms for

612
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:47,909
haptic interfaces of touch and motion

613
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,419
interfaces it's terms of code

614
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:53,759
interaction may be below or above normal

615
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,070
perceptual scales and may involve

616
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,779
autonomic nervous reactions as much as

617
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:02,730
if not more than the relatively blunt

618
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:04,799
gestures of hands and thumbs today's and

619
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,539
these dermal epidermal media both the

620
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,359
ones we have the ones who are in the

621
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,460
ones that we anticipate make it possible

622
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,139
to sense things about the external world

623
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,539
other work that our skin otherwise is

624
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:17,279
not able to register particulate matter

625
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,830
sense of the scale of parts per trillion

626
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,350
or things about our internal state of pH

627
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,179
balance in your sweat whatever but the

628
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,970
longer-term and really more interesting

629
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:29,879
design horizon for skin based media are

630
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,190
ones that would allow bodies novel and

631
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:33,960
unnatural forms of type sensation

632
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,590
that we have perhaps never experienced

633
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,370
before pleasure and pain are on the menu

634
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:43,289
but more besides so think of it this way

635
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,480
again early in experimental media and

636
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,070
their innovations with within artificial

637
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,889
visions and sights and sounds is one

638
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,169
precedent but also perhaps is molecular

639
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:55,889
gastronomy in the rebuilding of food

640
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,340
from first principles on up and if we

641
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:02,759
include taste is a particularly nuanced

642
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,639
form of touch which of course it is then

643
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:10,230
what are today novel tastes are models

644
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:10,860
for new sensations to come the same

645
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,389
holds true

646
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,200
I would hope the argue for the redesign

647
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:17,820
of the surfaces of the city its skins

648
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,289
urban interfaces are also sensory

649
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,750
mechanisms sometimes they're binary

650
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:24,120
gateways that allow a prohibited mission

651
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,370
to through the domain other times there

652
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,860
are reactive skins that sense threshold

653
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,980
events by reacting to light sound or

654
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,500
touch ambient trace elements and as we

655
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,019
meander the city these interfaces are

656
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,309
also our habitats and we dwell within

657
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:43,950
them but they are dwelling as well

658
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,110
they sense us as their world and we are

659
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,990
their habitat as much as they are ours

660
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:53,070
we are organisms living inside of them

661
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:55,740
just as they are inside of us ubiquitous

662
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:58,110
computing at and in the city skins and

663
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,450
surfaces and interfaces we see as

664
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,720
something like urbanism as nested

665
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:13,080
parasitism or nested parasitism as

666
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:15,149
urbanism no from touching to see by

667
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,470
shifting this line of inquiry up to this

668
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:19,379
urban scale illustrate what we take to

669
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,629
be the artificially mediated service

670
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:24,629
includes things that are analogous to

671
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:26,100
skin but we're job but we but also those

672
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:29,279
things that we would today referred to

673
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,419
colloquially as a kind of machine vision

674
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,700
quote unquote now vision has evolved

675
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:37,440
independently many times in evolutionary

676
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,559
history and arguably in the past two

677
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,820
decades or so it has evolved again this

678
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,279
time not for cuttlefish or rattles

679
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,350
but for Network CCD sensors and

680
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,080
algorithmic armatures processing what is

681
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,090
sensed into differentiating

682
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,210
differentiating and motivated

683
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,639
recognition and cognition

684
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:00,159
quote unquote visual sensors responding

685
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:02,470
to light often but not always shaped

686
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,470
like cameras are one kind of design

687
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,799
surface capable of synthetic sensation

688
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,330
and computational interpretation but in

689
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,370
the wider urban landscape they to

690
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:15,250
co-mingle with networks of other

691
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,899
surficial sensors responding to motion

692
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,509
and pressure and heat and ambient air

693
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:20,379
quality so forth and so on and so again

694
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:21,789
to the extent that it's

695
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,169
epistemologically and functionally

696
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,240
convenient we call these variously

697
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,379
machine vision machine hearing machine

698
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,120
skin but of course any real

699
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:30,639
correspondence to and from the mammalian

700
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,059
sensory apparatus is nearly allegorical

701
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:38,139
the AI city may be embodying itself but

702
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:40,899
as I'll say a few times not as we do now

703
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:43,029
as for the media technologies that

704
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,129
length or to let link these together

705
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:47,860
inserting into a particular question of

706
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:50,980
vision or light since we we might say

707
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,919
that when information is scarce then

708
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,190
copying something is the work of the

709
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,769
mechanical image however when

710
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:02,559
information is abundant especially when

711
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:05,139
it's over abundant then seeing the

712
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,870
original picking its pattern out of the

713
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:11,740
background this is the work of machine

714
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,750
vision for thinking animals seeing and

715
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,639
making things is easy but making copies

716
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,220
of what isn't seen and made it hard for

717
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:21,039
machines on the other hand making copies

718
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,649
is a way of seeing that is much easier

719
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,639
than thinking or perhaps is a kind of

720
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:29,850
thinking and in the varied history of

721
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:32,590
the multiple and as I say independent

722
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,570
evolutionary careers of vision various

723
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,919
photoreceptor cells found across the

724
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,740
phylum a have evolved from many

725
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,509
different kinds of chemoreceptors and

726
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,850
most likely well in advance of anything

727
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:46,850
we might recognize as a fully fledged

728
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:49,880
brain like information processing organ

729
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,340
further we could say that photosynthesis

730
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,009
is also and there's a chemical response

731
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,019
to light and so in the broadest sense it

732
00:29:55,009 --> 00:30:02,870
too could be considered as a kind of

733
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:06,549
vision without images no within the

734
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:09,830
animal Ian's vision image making Nexus

735
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:12,230
the one that we most successful is of

736
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,299
course primarily human and it's likely

737
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,360
that from the beginning to the end of

738
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:19,879
the Holocene that the total quantity of

739
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,179
images that humans have produced from

740
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:25,700
cave walls to face time measures

741
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,409
I don't know per year total pounds of

742
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,279
images total terabytes of information

743
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:34,580
supports continues to increase

744
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:37,399
exponentially now with digital imaging

745
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:40,220
machines in everyone's pocket the raw

746
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:43,940
sum of total images produced someone's

747
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:47,210
in Cincy or 2005 authors argue 2008 may

748
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:51,860
be more than all of those produced up to

749
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:55,399
that moment it depends of course on how

750
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,750
you define and quantify an image but the

751
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:59,000
vulture benjamin call the mechanical

752
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,309
reproducing roosters reproducibility has

753
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,269
certainly allowed images to proliferate

754
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:07,340
far beyond the means of human craft

755
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:09,740
further today many images are made for

756
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,929
no one but this does not mean that

757
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,360
they're functionalist they are made by

758
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:16,190
and for machines that see the world

759
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,379
differently than we do those machines

760
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,210
don't have eyeballs or rods and cones or

761
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,820
visual cortex but they do have sensors

762
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:27,379
that detect light in motion and form and

763
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,639
heat in color in other ways in such

764
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:30,710
today that the industrial scale

765
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,690
processing of that data that has been

766
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,179
gleaned by scanning the light spectrum

767
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,620
in some way from urban scale Street

768
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,740
surveillance can millimeter scale

769
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,690
quality control along assembly lines

770
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,940
represents a significant fraction of all

771
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,799
of the work that the world does to image

772
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,830
itself for the purpose of governing

773
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:51,019
human society the end of the day the

774
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:55,610
machining phylum may take more selfies

775
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:58,370
than cells do however the function of

776
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,230
representation at work here is probably

777
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,960
rather

778
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:05,919
the quote-unquote image may likely

779
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:08,529
remain data that has never rerender to

780
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:12,340
look like a picture because there's no

781
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:15,159
need an algorithm program to discern a

782
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,080
particular pattern or anomaly can see it

783
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:18,549
directly in the data itself it doesn't

784
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,159
necessarily need for that data to be

785
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:22,960
projected as if for a mammal and then

786
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,260
reaching and reinterpreted back into

787
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,510
code like any like like any algorithmic

788
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,120
scanning and sorting of a any large data

789
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:35,940
set the fact that the original source

790
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,590
was or is visual is not so critical so

791
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,529
again like plants do machines also

792
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:44,080
possess a kind of vision without images

793
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:45,460
or at least a kind of image a kind of

794
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,830
image with that suggests a very

795
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,299
different form of abstraction toward a

796
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,220
very different kind of corporeal

797
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:52,809
experience that is a an abstraction

798
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,480
that's based on chemical or

799
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:57,490
informational pattern finding as as that

800
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,529
cartographic simulation of experience or

801
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:03,880
as that experience itself perhaps

802
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:07,630
surprising to some perhaps not to others

803
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,850
then that the function of machine ik

804
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,299
images today and up there abstractions

805
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,880
both animal and algorithmic is in many

806
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:18,370
cases if not actually predominantly to

807
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,769
determine the veracity and originality

808
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:24,549
of what those images supposedly

809
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:27,130
represent for example some of the shapes

810
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,350
printed on dollar bills or euros or

811
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,269
Swiss francs of take your pick are there

812
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,480
for humans to differentiate the value of

813
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:36,940
one token from another but far more our

814
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,870
for machine vision counterfeit detection

815
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,720
to verify that this is a real dollar the

816
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,510
piece of paper is full of machines that

817
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:51,399
happen to look like pictures and it is

818
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:54,130
an image as machine or a surveillance

819
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,779
scan of a city may pick out one face one

820
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,919
body from the thousands of motions

821
00:33:55,779 --> 00:34:01,510
looking for the one true target

822
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,700
elsewhere we insert tiny camera probes

823
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,370
into great paintings to verify that they

824
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,450
are originals this is often required by

825
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,950
insurance companies

826
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,720
purchases online capture software shows

827
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,760
us an image and then in a quick

828
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,679
inversion of the Turing test analyzes

829
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,990
how the human user interprets it to

830
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,220
determines if they are in fact a real

831
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:26,500
person so we conclude perhaps that venue

832
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,540
means assurances that mechanical

833
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,780
reproduction would undermine the aura of

834
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,790
the original is true when for example we

835
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,800
compare a painting with a postcard of a

836
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,230
painting

837
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,490
however machine vision and images as

838
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,820
machines are put to work to ensure our

839
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:48,730
attic originals verified non fakes true

840
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,179
identities unbroken versions normal

841
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:54,490
targets certified real deals and so a

842
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,950
kind of revolution is made back around

843
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,650
as the image is more fully technologized

844
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:02,050
as it becomes itself a machine in some

845
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,060
cases then menu means historical art

846
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,829
from the pre mechanical original to

847
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,730
mechanical copy is incomplete without

848
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:13,140
another curve leading now to what the

849
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,140
machine is authentic

850
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,210
still if we if we if cities are always

851
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,890
in there some way about vision to some

852
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,920
degree in again benjamine makes an

853
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:26,410
appearance here's what as well we think

854
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,569
of this in terms of how we see it which

855
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,520
is fun or see each other through it also

856
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:32,829
fine but should also think of it in

857
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:37,510
terms of how it sees on its own terms

858
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:39,670
the machine ik visual subject that it

859
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,740
puts forth is not something that's that

860
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,569
possesses necessarily human-like or

861
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:47,710
human level perceptual and aesthetic

862
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:49,839
capacities of discernment of connoisseur

863
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,910
ship but rather something that is

864
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,930
interesting because it does not possess

865
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,760
those things and yet can see us

866
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:02,500
recognize us and know us regardless and

867
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,880
that's weird enough so there's the

868
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,970
question on the Waggoner how the world

869
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,040
looks as a screen and another more

870
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,740
important I think is how we look as

871
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,460
objects of perception from the position

872
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,890
of machines with which we co-op I that

873
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,230
world

874
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,749
seeing ourselves through the eyes of

875
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,609
this machine and other who does not and

876
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:26,839
cannot have an effective sense of

877
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:30,239
aesthetics is a kind of disenchantment

878
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:32,430
we are just stuff in the world for

879
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,019
distributed and machine cognition to

880
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,700
look at and to make sense of our own

881
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:40,799
sapiens is real and unique but but as we

882
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,079
are things to observe that just happened

883
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:46,950
to be sapiens this doesn't really matter

884
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,869
to machine vision this decision

885
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,460
challenge I think is more than just like

886
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:52,230
hearing the sound of the record this

887
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,989
recorded sound of your voice on tape

888
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,759
that can't possibly be me it's

889
00:36:54,989 --> 00:37:00,569
potentially the clearing away of a more

890
00:36:56,759 --> 00:37:02,309
closely guarded illusion this

891
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:04,170
uncomfortable recognition in the

892
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,799
machines mirror is a kind of perhaps a

893
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:09,450
reverse uncanny valley that is instead

894
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:11,309
of being creeped out at how slightly

895
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,140
inhuman the creature in the image

896
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:15,660
appears were creeped out at how unhuman

897
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:22,859
we ourselves look through the creatures

898
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:24,989
eyes know the politics of this are also

899
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:28,140
that person is worse

900
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:30,089
frog mentally you're writing a book has

901
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,819
been doing about artificial intelligence

902
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,980
I found in some ways I didn't expect

903
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:37,619
that it's in many ways fully impossible

904
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,079
to separate the technology itself from

905
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:42,450
the sometimes bizarre ideas that we have

906
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,160
for it and about it and as I'm

907
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,450
fascinated by how technologies are not

908
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,059
only anthropomorphised

909
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:51,079
but how some are considered menacing and

910
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:53,339
others amazing and some both at once

911
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,410
there's a way in which part of this is a

912
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:57,599
part of a genealogy that we might take

913
00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,059
you know at least through the Taos and

914
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,339
the influencing machine the ways in

915
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:04,529
which this this apparatus just beyond

916
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:08,460
our understanding come to take on a kind

917
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:09,930
of psychiatric significance whether the

918
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,880
aliens are reading your thoughts through

919
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,170
radio waves and dental implants or

920
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,650
Google is reading your thoughts through

921
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,849
the email the borderlands between

922
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,789
schizophrenia and sensible vigilance

923
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:22,579
delusion and deductions are disputed

924
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:24,839
territory

925
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:26,070
perhaps it comes down to a level of

926
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,690
discomfort not just

927
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,800
how some people see technologies but

928
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,860
with how some people think of

929
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,740
technologies see them the occult

930
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:37,110
artifacts of planetary scale computation

931
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,260
are a cracked mirror and reflections

932
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,770
seen there are given to a manichaean and

933
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:47,160
dualistic and sometimes even bipolar

934
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:50,610
political psychiatric imaginary for

935
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,290
example deep dream last summer was here

936
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,490
we have this the deep dreams that these

937
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,900
are do so to tell you about these in a

938
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,820
moment that is appropriate approvals

939
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,850
research had released sometimes the

940
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,440
summer be fo Franco Berardi and I were

941
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,350
having breakfast as well he and I we

942
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,910
don't particularly see we don't usually

943
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,920
think about Google in the same way so

944
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,630
let's say but we were both totally

945
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,980
amazed by these images with this as well

946
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:13,520
as other sort of ongoing conversations

947
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,810
about this really read these represent a

948
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,400
new kind of image we haven't seen the

949
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,690
board so in such a long time

950
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,460
so those of you want to familiar with

951
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,050
these as well basically what your second

952
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,610
then on that to have summer day last

953
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:27,990
june happen to be on the front page of

954
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:30,030
every newspaper was a project undertaken

955
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,740
by google research where notions a sort

956
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,600
of object and out sort of feature

957
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,070
recognition algorithms that will analyze

958
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,900
large datasets to look for particular

959
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,940
things how it is that your photo app

960
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,650
knows you know which would face you are

961
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,820
that's a horse or a dog with russia this

962
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,800
is well they're interested in a ways

963
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,690
like how do you what kind of feedback

964
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,100
loops could this sort of provide what

965
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,990
happens if it tries to see something

966
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,850
that's not there but you force it to see

967
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,170
it organ or you ask it to see it so

968
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,510
often this as well and this is kind of

969
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,100
what this done in this simplest sort of

970
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,200
explanation there's the process is kind

971
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,580
of simple find edges function like you

972
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,140
might do in photoshop where you sort of

973
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,030
filter the image just to make the edges

974
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,160
everything a bit more what it is in

975
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,660
relationship good things around it you

976
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,700
then ask me to look for the thing that

977
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,770
it's looking for and then you do this

978
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,150
again and then you've good again and

979
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,410
then again and you feed this back

980
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,700
through the system over and over and

981
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,250
over and over and over again and it

982
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,960
starts to actually compress the image

983
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,970
and start to find things that it's

984
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,180
looking for that aren't actually they're

985
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:28,470
a kind of AI hallucination if you like

986
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,760
now there's a bunch of websites you can

987
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,210
go to you can take your own vacation

988
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,980
photos and upload them and have them

989
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,990
dreama fine if you like food is horrible

990
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,190
to do this as well

991
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:44,470
porn also will not recommend it

992
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,420
no the images I think are remarkable

993
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,369
enough on their own irrespective of

994
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,440
their Providence but once the viewer I

995
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,359
think makes the partial of course it's

996
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,280
always partial empathetic transference

997
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,290
into the other mind of this feature

998
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,200
recognition algorithm and its way of

999
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,820
seeing something the effect in a way I'm

1000
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,800
kind of trying on a new mode of

1001
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,810
perception making sense of the work

1002
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,710
through those eyes actually that's the

1003
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:11,740
real payoff even if it's an example as I

1004
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:16,240
say here of a kind of AI apophenia the

1005
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:18,280
false positive as a court so what is the

1006
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,680
front tuck stop on this for a moment

1007
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,300
what is apathy apathy Nia is the it's a

1008
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,730
psychological phenomenon of false

1009
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,510
pattern recognition or you see a pattern

1010
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,010
in something that's not really there

1011
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:31,839
pareidolia is the subtype of fine

1012
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,490
rabbity where you see faces and things

1013
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,109
that aren't really there and receive

1014
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,240
them whether you mean whether you want

1015
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,770
to or not you can say it's not a face I

1016
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,349
know it's not a face you're going to see

1017
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,990
a face it's not necessarily a kind of

1018
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:46,720
process that you can be you know the

1019
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:49,540
disenchanted oh by just by being told so

1020
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,430
away but it's a it's a you know

1021
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,080
causation causality dynamic where you

1022
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,609
see some correspondence between things

1023
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,080
in it and you deduce that there must be

1024
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:57,430
some causal relationship between these

1025
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,190
two things in general if these sort of

1026
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:02,230
pattern structures of apathy conspiracy

1027
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:04,990
theory is a placenta as a form of

1028
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:08,290
political science if you like in this

1029
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,089
one as well but it's who we are and what

1030
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,920
we do it's in this kind of pattern

1031
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:15,070
finding even the false pattern finding

1032
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,410
is intrinsic and necessary to our

1033
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,880
evolution into our sapiens we are who we

1034
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:23,440
are and can't sort of done without it

1035
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,359
think of it this way there's a character

1036
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,920
I'll tell you so there's character and

1037
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,609
Peter Walter Eason almost one of a

1038
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,400
handful of really good novels about AI

1039
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:35,109
novel called echo Pratt CO and in this

1040
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,560
story one of the character relays this

1041
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:39,780
this this this

1042
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:43,410
explaining apophenia to one of the other

1043
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,850
characters in the in the novel the

1044
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,490
character then argues that this false

1045
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:49,770
pattern-recognition is hardwired into

1046
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,480
our Homo sapiens evolutionary success

1047
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,980
and the story goes like this tens of

1048
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,890
thousands of years ago two guys are

1049
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:59,520
hiding in the tall grass quietly looking

1050
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:01,740
around for both predator and prey one of

1051
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,120
them sees a faint but distinct anomaly

1052
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,800
in the way the light breaks through the

1053
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,600
grass moving left to right and he

1054
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,300
recognizes this pattern as that of a

1055
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,060
looming cat and runs away back to the

1056
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,680
village leaving his friend who does not

1057
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:17,190
possess those pattern recognition genes

1058
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,690
to be eaten the guy who ran away was

1059
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,030
able to reproduce his pattern

1060
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,310
recognition genes ensure his and their

1061
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,440
survival and the guy who did not possess

1062
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,620
those genes did not reproduce simple as

1063
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,560
that

1064
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,330
however there was a third guy sitting in

1065
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,270
a similar grass perhaps the morning

1066
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:35,220
earlier he too thought there was a tiger

1067
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,440
and got up and ran back to the safety of

1068
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,920
the village but in this case there was

1069
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,730
no Tiger it was all in his mind he was

1070
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,650
not cunning he was paranoid yet he too

1071
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,630
was able to respond reproduce and his

1072
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,220
faulty pattern recognition genes which

1073
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,720
are perhaps actually the same thing as

1074
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,490
the first guy's accurate pattern

1075
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,410
recognition genes were also able to

1076
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,100
reproduce as well perhaps with the

1077
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,140
second guys

1078
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,150
wife I don't know the lesson is that

1079
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,640
evolution has greatly rewarded both

1080
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:04,470
positive human successful human pattern

1081
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,230
recognition but is also bound

1082
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,520
inextricably bound inextricably to the

1083
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,980
bounty of that bargain

1084
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:17,780
it has also rewarded hallucination and

1085
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:21,780
error and so it's one thing to caution

1086
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,440
paranoia about Google but it's but it's

1087
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,390
not as if Google's algorithms are

1088
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,840
themselves as if they are not themselves

1089
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:34,740
also deeply paranoid after all they see

1090
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:37,020
psychedelic logs faces in everything now

1091
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:40,500
the reason the deep dream hallucinates

1092
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,480
dogs is itself not spooky its object

1093
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,680
recognition faculties were used trained

1094
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,990
during an image

1095
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,089
data set called imagenet which is based

1096
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,500
on various breeds of dogs you can treat

1097
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:51,240
dogs all with different you train your

1098
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,380
reckon should identify that the poodle

1099
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,390
and a Great Dane I like they're all

1100
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,000
constituted dog it's that's easier than

1101
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,859
the you know it's it's this is a

1102
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,250
difficult accomplishment and so it will

1103
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:04,710
therefore hallucinate dogs where there

1104
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,790
are none and to identify people as dogs

1105
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:11,280
if it's told to look at them hard enough

1106
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:13,290
now this ladder may seem insulting but

1107
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,839
maybe it shouldn't you call the Diogenes

1108
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,849
proto cause Napolitan ISM is based after

1109
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:22,109
all and the glorious dog like community

1110
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:25,109
of us all and so deep dreams images are

1111
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:27,329
artifacts of computers hallucinations of

1112
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:30,420
phantom conclusions then perhaps the

1113
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:33,780
conspiratorial figure cut by Eagle goo

1114
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:36,780
evil Google stepfather is that same

1115
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,809
paranoid vision turn inside out and back

1116
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,730
on itself perhaps the Google the AI is

1117
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,309
this paranoid in how it sees us as some

1118
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,650
of us are in how we see it it's not

1119
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:50,280
coincidental or surprising then that as

1120
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:52,260
AI matures its own pattern recognition

1121
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,250
faculties would reach the plateau and

1122
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:58,710
accomplishment of creative a plenum from

1123
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,760
Antonin Artaud to Seymour Cray there's

1124
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,980
no common ways in which we have

1125
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,380
perceived some kind of homology between

1126
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:08,700
abnormal human psychology and various

1127
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:10,980
machine behaviors and so is machine

1128
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,869
vision paranoid is our popular

1129
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,609
understanding of machine vision paranoid

1130
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:18,290
what is Google up to are they watching

1131
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:20,849
you and if so who or what are they see

1132
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:23,040
is our understanding of Google's

1133
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:24,960
paranoid machine vision itself paranoid

1134
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,790
making the paranoid AI that much more

1135
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,349
paranoid in response in a word yes

1136
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:33,750
is this how artificial intelligence

1137
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:36,589
should evolve in relation shoe ship to

1138
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:39,329
and autonomously from human intelligence

1139
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:40,770
well if the pattern recognition is

1140
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,020
pattern recognition human pattern

1141
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:45,690
recognition is any indicator based both

1142
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:50,750
on productive and destructive apathy Nia

1143
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:53,050
deception and delusion then yes and no

1144
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:57,500
so

1145
00:46:53,050 --> 00:47:00,560
moving then back up in scale to the AI

1146
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,490
machine sensing as a whole at the level

1147
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,680
of the whole city

1148
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:07,190
and in this redistribution of the

1149
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,870
resettable again the AI city may be

1150
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:13,400
embodying itself but not as we do the

1151
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,340
commingling of diverse sensors of light

1152
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,200
and air and sound in chemistry draws a

1153
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:21,200
landscape of sensing and thinking little

1154
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,330
species partially embodied discretely

1155
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,640
one with another and partially come

1156
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,440
embodied with one another as their

1157
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,440
information inputs are aggregated

1158
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,910
modeled and acted upon in various

1159
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,250
pluralities Homo sapiens comes equipped

1160
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:39,560
with an extraordinary array of sensory

1161
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,650
faculties which is we discuss may be

1162
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,720
augmented further by synthetic layers in

1163
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,340
various ratios ranging from the sensors

1164
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,070
and trackers and our phones that we

1165
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,140
carry about like meals to more intimate

1166
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,290
media of strengths of artificial images

1167
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,730
and sight and sounds

1168
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,160
situating ourselves in this expanded

1169
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:02,810
field again we are both sensors and

1170
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,630
sensed on the one hand we are primary

1171
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:07,730
sapient actor in the drama supervising

1172
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,500
an orchestra of sensing technologies

1173
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,540
each individually capable of functional

1174
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,540
processing and together of certain forms

1175
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:18,680
of aggregate emergent intelligence such

1176
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,440
as SARS for example our neurons on the

1177
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,190
other were not only the subject of the

1178
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,870
scenario we are also its subject matter

1179
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,330
then wider urban landscape of synthetic

1180
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,610
sensory systems is not only a platform

1181
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,350
through which we extend and extrapolate

1182
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,540
our capacities for abstraction

1183
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:38,500
distributed cognition it's also capable

1184
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,940
of other sorts of abstraction on its own

1185
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,790
there's part of its intelligence it

1186
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,990
looks at us and registers abstractions

1187
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:51,560
about us and again that not just a are

1188
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:54,920
in the city but nested AI Co embodied as

1189
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,260
the city with very different sorts of

1190
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,290
organisms to population to genome

1191
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:04,340
kanesha to signal morphologies at work

1192
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,680
and thus the work of abstract

1193
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,830
for organism for design more generally

1194
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,380
is not only to deploy abstract forms but

1195
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,780
to set in motion mechanisms and programs

1196
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,060
that are capable of their own feats of

1197
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:20,870
abstraction and to calibrate how they

1198
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:24,080
abstract us and one another a quarter in

1199
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:25,730
short we should imagine an AI urbanism a

1200
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,520
bit consumed in sort of like Vienna

1201
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,770
college stroll into the field populated

1202
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:34,700
by intermingling but neutrally oblivious

1203
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:37,610
little life worlds or terms of de luces

1204
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,740
parable of the kick the later weight

1205
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:41,540
laying in wait for some threshold event

1206
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:44,390
to come its way at which point its

1207
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:48,410
triggers programmed response leaping out

1208
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:50,690
into its own little void many of our

1209
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,900
urban sensors and their limited forms of

1210
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:57,680
AI work similarly and with similar

1211
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:59,900
nobility more versatile synthetic

1212
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,540
intelligence occupy more complex will

1213
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,730
develop some are predators and prey some

1214
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:07,700
are in motion summer flowering some

1215
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,590
pollinating and as we stroll along them

1216
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,410
we may be registered by them or we may

1217
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:14,630
be ignored may be a primary cause of

1218
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,370
concern we may be a passing interference

1219
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:19,570
in an evolutionary dynamic in which we

1220
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:24,170
are neither the protagonist nor target

1221
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:26,750
and this is anyway as we might expect

1222
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,510
actually not so surprising as we we know

1223
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,190
ships from top down to bottom up AI

1224
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:33,680
particularly robotics have been marked

1225
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:36,950
by shift of emphasis from intelligence

1226
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,600
as a formal at the syntax to one of a

1227
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:42,170
specifically embodied relation to

1228
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,730
specific worlds and models heuristic

1229
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,040
knowledge of habitats is seen as

1230
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:49,640
inseparable from how an AI manipulates

1231
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,080
is situated problem space and so in

1232
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,300
robotics through the pairing of

1233
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,010
synthetic sensing and visual for example

1234
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,500
with algorithmic reasoning allows for

1235
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,180
simple artificial species to perform

1236
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,430
intelligently because they have what

1237
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,470
amounts to functionally an embodied

1238
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:06,940
perceptual location in the world they

1239
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,940
can think because they can see

1240
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:15,140
now the implications of all of this for

1241
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,790
our politics of geopolitics and all the

1242
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,520
rest of us as I say are fraught and

1243
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:22,010
tangled and profound and banal in

1244
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,050
various measures extends from the

1245
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,490
biochemistry of climates and ecosystems

1246
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,750
to the rhetorical conventions of

1247
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,910
citizenship and sovereignty

1248
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:32,330
it's Messier is what we're talking about

1249
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:36,160
not a kind of clean and pure AI and so

1250
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:38,240
I'll conclude presentation with a few

1251
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,790
admonitions toward a general

1252
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,810
interdisciplinary design grateful for AI

1253
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:50,920
and for what we might call the post and

1254
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:53,450
throughout the scene it is at best a

1255
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,990
paradoxical accomplishment to survive a

1256
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,820
mass extinction event the modern human

1257
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:00,590
species has the dubious distinction of

1258
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,060
not only observing and measuring mass

1259
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,200
extinction while it has happened but

1260
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,300
also doing so with the understanding

1261
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:11,800
that it is one preen of the preeminent

1262
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,800
agents of that event it does so with the

1263
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:17,720
ambivalent comfort that that one way or

1264
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,350
another it too is unlikely to survive

1265
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:27,040
the bloody edge of the Anthropocene

1266
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:29,320
intact as so much departs what arrives

1267
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,600
simultaneously with the collapse of

1268
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,880
biodiversity we also see at least the

1269
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,040
strong potential for an explosion of new

1270
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,560
quote-unquote species taking form

1271
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,320
through robotics and synthetic biology

1272
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,940
and artificial intelligence we can't see

1273
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:50,060
the latter as replacements for the

1274
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:52,070
former and yet there they are recall for

1275
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,950
example that the first Earthlings in

1276
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,990
space were not humans and that a very

1277
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:00,619
low percentage of all Earthlings in

1278
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:04,220
space have been humans human biology is

1279
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:06,230
needy and fragile it is poorly suited to

1280
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,960
space travel largely because we have to

1281
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,940
bring an entire ecosystem with us from

1282
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,130
oxygen to radiation filters to the

1283
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:15,769
microbial biome in our test

1284
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:19,039
could help us digest food as currently

1285
00:53:15,769 --> 00:53:21,710
configured humans we cannot really

1286
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:25,670
believe earth because we have to bring a

1287
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:27,410
miniature earth with us when we go this

1288
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,490
is not true in the same way for other

1289
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,230
species which should provide

1290
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,420
comparatively easy in space such as

1291
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,200
metalloid robotics and perhaps also

1292
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:38,720
Sunday some kinds of synthetic biology

1293
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,880
and so perhaps like the small mammals

1294
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,089
that took about that took over after the

1295
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,430
cretaceous-paleogene extinction they're

1296
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:49,789
just better suited to the very different

1297
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:52,970
punctuated equilibrium to come they may

1298
00:53:49,789 --> 00:54:00,019
enjoy successes that we cannot leaving

1299
00:53:52,970 --> 00:54:02,990
us behind and stranded in place so what

1300
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:06,109
comes then after an Anthropocene

1301
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:08,000
extinction the only thing we can know

1302
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:10,009
about the post and throughout the scene

1303
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,690
is that it's an era in which humans

1304
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:15,859
would no longer be at the dominant

1305
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:17,869
geologic actor perhaps a new earthling

1306
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:19,640
species may prove to be more fit better

1307
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:21,319
than making the next evolutionary steps

1308
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,480
than humans are and so for us to quote

1309
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:26,750
survive we may have to become more like

1310
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,970
them and much like what we are now in

1311
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:32,359
the longer view humans role may be that

1312
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:34,970
of an enabling intermediary between

1313
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:37,369
early primates and as yet to emerge

1314
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:42,349
phyla that blend organic and inorganic

1315
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:44,779
flesh and thinking this is the point of

1316
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:47,150
convergence between robust AI and the

1317
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:49,910
deep ecologies of voluntary human

1318
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,910
extinction but instead of disappearing

1319
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,680
however we may survive by perforating

1320
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:59,000
the boundaries between animal vegetable

1321
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:02,029
and mineral as a design is that as our

1322
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,500
design problem and design solution and

1323
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:05,240
so what are the stages the depth of the

1324
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,220
user has a certain kind of death of a

1325
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:10,640
student for humanism and the eclipse of

1326
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,289
a certain sort of resolute humanism it

1327
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,390
does so because it brings with it also

1328
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:17,119
the multiplication and proliferation of

1329
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:21,050
other forms of non-human in human actual

1330
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,210
human agents and subjects including

1331
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,860
censors and algorithms and robots from

1332
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,950
nanometric to landscape-scale any

1333
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,190
combination of which with which we may

1334
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:36,170
enter into a kind of relationship as a

1335
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:38,330
composite subject the complexities and

1336
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:40,280
contradictions of those sovereignties in

1337
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,380
relationship to those composites are

1338
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,810
nevertheless in with those quasi

1339
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,090
intelligent sensei's actors as I say

1340
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:49,250
work to dismember certain conventional

1341
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:52,060
distinctions between subject and true

1342
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:54,370
occupant and city and so and so forth

1343
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,720
introduces a certain kind of

1344
00:55:54,370 --> 00:56:00,290
redistribution of a certain kind of

1345
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,850
agnostic universal suffrage by which set

1346
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:04,240
what kinds of matter can enter into that

1347
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:07,220
position to take on that to that throne

1348
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,620
claiming is strongly a different kind of

1349
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:12,440
strong materials perspective in

1350
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:16,010
territory and but we anticipate without

1351
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:19,370
a doubt but as this as this works itself

1352
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:22,510
out as that disenchantment unfolds that

1353
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:25,040
we anticipate all manner of pushback

1354
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:27,620
against this demystified and demonized

1355
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,810
mathematics not only distaste for

1356
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,370
certain forms of quantification and a

1357
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:34,280
preference for romantic verse for

1358
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:36,080
example but a bulwark on behalf of what

1359
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,930
amounts to a pre Copernican and deeply

1360
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,670
reactionary humanist exceptionalism even

1361
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:45,560
a humanist fundamentalism I push back as

1362
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,270
I say as frivolous perhaps as rationally

1363
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,280
irrational there there are that is

1364
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,020
certain affinities with certain

1365
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,580
technologies however fictitious of

1366
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,010
bizarre those affinities maybe that are

1367
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:58,480
thought to embody the essence of a kind

1368
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:01,340
of Croatian astre one of these is food

1369
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:06,800
or had certain forms of technologies of

1370
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:09,110
personal mastery such as the car I think

1371
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,610
when the Google X was beginning to work

1372
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,110
on the driver the driverless car project

1373
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,550
they want up and visited the labs up

1374
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:16,040
there with a student of mine who was not

1375
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:17,480
working on that tonight we're meeting

1376
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,840
with in my essence you guys must have

1377
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:22,160
heard a lot of different kind of strange

1378
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,590
strange ideas about what the driverless

1379
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,260
car system is going to amount to and how

1380
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:28,230
what to sort of push back from it

1381
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,890
that this is well and they say well

1382
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,210
funny you should ask

1383
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:34,060
they pull off this piece of paper which

1384
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:35,770
is the intention to file a potential

1385
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,790
file pre-emptive legal notice or

1386
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,160
something which as far as they could

1387
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,690
tell is just a completely made-up

1388
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,760
document is no such thing from a group

1389
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:44,440
called Gun Owners of America which is an

1390
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,860
advocacy group a bit to the right of the

1391
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,660
net out they Hannah right and and you

1392
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,460
remember that in the United States alone

1393
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,260
roughly about thirty thousand people a

1394
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,940
year are killed in car accidents but

1395
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,530
twenty and eight thousand a year of

1396
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,310
those are directly attributable to human

1397
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,400
driver error

1398
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,630
and so if driverless cars could kill

1399
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,780
twenty seven thousand people a year or

1400
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,610
less they would still be a you know from

1401
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,980
purely consequentialist view of ethical

1402
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:10,420
bit of advantage and so the idea that it

1403
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,120
would be under certain point league

1404
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:14,470
determined for purposes of you know we

1405
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,050
presume that putting a human behind the

1406
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,930
wheel is just too great of a risk it's

1407
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,400
just an unethical to put everyone else

1408
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,080
at risk in this sort of set in this in

1409
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,240
this kind of way it makes it makes sense

1410
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:27,190
and so what this legal thing was with

1411
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,470
this dog were saying is like should it

1412
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:32,050
become illegal for humans to drive a car

1413
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,570
in this way that they will seek to have

1414
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:36,730
automobiles reclassified as ammunition

1415
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,930
and thereby covered by the Second

1416
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,850
Amendment of the Constitution which

1417
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:43,230
guarantees the right to bear arms in

1418
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,230
this case a car

1419
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,829
or but this way your life may be ended

1420
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,049
by someone encased in a two-ton steel

1421
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:57,119
box careening down the asphalt trying to

1422
00:58:55,049 --> 00:59:00,920
prove a point about his how technology

1423
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,920
will never capture his natural humanity

1424
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,290
now although this is not without real

1425
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:09,930
risk we we anticipate that this

1426
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:12,510
distribution of perception and Co

1427
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:16,740
embodiment implied by sensei AI at the

1428
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:18,780
urban scale would if we are attentive

1429
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:20,880
and persistent shift and expand what we

1430
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,210
take to be an ethics of shelter and of

1431
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:27,359
encounter of negotiation and even

1432
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:30,119
immunity and in this the modern era of

1433
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,619
form of urban anime may pale in

1434
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,990
comparison to the challengers of

1435
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:36,000
predator prey camouflage dissimulation

1436
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:39,500
relationships implied by the emergence

1437
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,030
of various alien minds of urban scale

1438
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,260
negotiating our way to a livable postin

1439
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,960
throughout the scene necessitates

1440
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:50,160
however i still argue a fidelity to

1441
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:53,099
emergence not to emergency because

1442
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,290
Copernican traumas that abolish the

1443
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:57,089
false centrality and specialness of

1444
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:02,130
human thought and species being are

1445
00:59:57,089 --> 01:00:05,819
priceless accomplishments the advent of

1446
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:07,740
robust inhuman AI could provide for

1447
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:09,420
similar disenchantment one that should

1448
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,190
enable a more reality based

1449
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,280
understanding of ourselves of our

1450
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,170
situation and a fuller and more complex

1451
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,109
and nuanced understanding of what

1452
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:22,530
intelligence is what thinking is and is

1453
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:25,109
not and from there we can hopefully make

1454
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:27,450
our world with greater confidence that

1455
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:31,460
our models are good approximations of

1456
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:35,160
what's out there always a helpful thing

1457
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:38,010
an additional harm and an additional

1458
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,349
harm of the alternative to that is in

1459
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,089
perpetuating a relationship to

1460
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:44,990
technology that has brought us to the

1461
01:00:42,089 --> 01:00:46,980
precipice of a sixth great extinction

1462
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:49,980
arguably and I would make the argument

1463
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,440
if the Anthropocene itself is do less to

1464
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,150
technology run amok then to the humanist

1465
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,770
legacy that

1466
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,930
understands the world as having been

1467
01:00:54,770 --> 01:01:00,289
given for our needs and created in our

1468
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:02,660
image we still see this everywhere our

1469
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:06,829
computing culture is deeply confused and

1470
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:08,809
so and is so along these same lines we

1471
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:10,789
vacillate between thinking technology as

1472
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:12,410
a transparent extension of our desires

1473
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:14,299
on the one hand and of thinking of it as

1474
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,089
an unstoppable and linear historical

1475
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:18,799
course on the other for the first agency

1476
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:21,260
is magically ours alone and for the

1477
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,180
second agencies all in the code that's

1478
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:26,270
gross inflation of the former is merely

1479
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:29,230
inverted back into the other and this is

1480
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:31,339
why we can't have nice things

1481
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:33,140
well-known did thought leader in the

1482
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:35,569
world of design recently read shelves

1483
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,369
and peel and remain nameless quote it's

1484
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:39,049
time to invert invent a world where

1485
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:43,039
machines are subservient to the needs

1486
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:47,359
and wishes of humanity quote simply

1487
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:50,109
breathtaking if you think so I invite

1488
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:52,430
you to Google pig decapitating machine

1489
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:53,900
and then let's talk about inventing

1490
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:57,410
worlds in which machines are wholly

1491
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:59,240
subservient to human wishes one wonders

1492
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:01,520
whether it's only from a society that

1493
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,380
one scape theological and legislative

1494
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,029
comfort to chattel slavery that this

1495
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:09,650
particular claim could be offered with

1496
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:11,990
such satisfied naivete this is the

1497
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,089
sentiment this philosophy of technology

1498
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:15,799
exactly that is the basic algorithm of

1499
01:02:14,089 --> 01:02:19,400
answer the scenic predicament it's time

1500
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:25,700
to move on this pretentious folklore is

1501
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:27,710
too expensive and so but to put in goods

1502
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:30,140
put differently please to make

1503
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:32,059
technology serve humans and serve human

1504
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:35,500
needs and desires requirements appear

1505
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:37,460
utterly misguided and even suicidal

1506
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,680
scaring upon the abyss of mass

1507
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:42,170
extinction we hear the dreary early

1508
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,900
common refrain variously explicit or

1509
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,760
latent that identifies quote modern

1510
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,069
technology as the main culprit and

1511
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,470
conclusion that the most fundamental

1512
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:54,349
solution is 2d technologies the planet

1513
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:55,859
and to Rehim annoys ourselves one

1514
01:02:54,349 --> 01:02:57,829
presupposing the other in very

1515
01:02:55,859 --> 01:03:01,019
measures this is among the worst

1516
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:04,999
possible plans both philosophically and

1517
01:03:01,019 --> 01:03:07,890
practically first it's tragically death

1518
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:10,589
to the priceless Copernican trauma of

1519
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,989
the anthropogenic precipice that our

1520
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:15,210
status as the dominant geologic actor is

1521
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:17,099
fleeting and so in order to survive you

1522
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,220
have to become something that is not

1523
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:21,569
necessarily recognizably human and

1524
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,279
seconded props up a psychotic

1525
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:26,849
misrepresentation about humans and

1526
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:28,619
humanism actually are we or the

1527
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:30,930
brain-eating Apes with weaponized

1528
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:33,269
hydrogen atoms who organize their

1529
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:35,609
societies according to Bronze Age poetry

1530
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:40,259
on human sacrifice and ritual

1531
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:43,559
purification among the last projects to

1532
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:46,369
support is Rehan ization in any sense of

1533
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:51,779
a direct return to historical norms I

1534
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:56,099
think the other species would agree but

1535
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:58,559
lastly the word of desire then how do we

1536
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,480
mount this for technological material

1537
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,880
recompensing as a theory of subjectivity

1538
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,279
against the tropes or with the tropes of

1539
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:10,769
heroes and sanitize its treatment

1540
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:12,569
Freud barely had Darwin to work with let

1541
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:14,579
alone genetics and genomics and so as

1542
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:16,289
you probably read those terms you're

1543
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:20,400
probably Brett we read a little bit like

1544
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:22,319
one reads the Greeks organic vs.

1545
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,989
inorganic that is whether something is

1546
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,089
alive or not alive is kind of the miner

1547
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:28,799
is sort of a minor issue or something

1548
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:30,480
having our not having a carbon molecule

1549
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:33,960
this is what the point something goes

1550
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,119
organic is it this thing any any melting

1551
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:38,249
back into the inorganic with an atomic

1552
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:40,799
impulse no into the over comment

1553
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:43,140
overwhelmed by an absorbed by matter

1554
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:46,230
itself may be a way of encountering and

1555
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:48,299
either desiring death perhaps but it's

1556
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:52,380
also in many ways a very everyday kind

1557
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:54,359
of occurrence it's not a sad destiny to

1558
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,489
be interwoven in a matter and other

1559
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:58,529
diagram and other diagrams for that

1560
01:04:56,489 --> 01:05:03,150
dissolution of possible both anatomic

1561
01:04:58,529 --> 01:05:05,339
and economic the human body and this

1562
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:09,200
earthly landscape of matter are only the

1563
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:11,700
default settings they're not destiny

1564
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,130
chemistry may drive the most radical

1565
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:17,519
forms of the philosophical imaginary to

1566
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:18,180
come a culinary materialism is what puts

1567
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:24,269
it yes

1568
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:25,739
rubbing the Clinton raw and so here

1569
01:05:24,269 --> 01:05:27,720
among the algorithms that whining

1570
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:29,339
evolution revision returns to the

1571
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,680
primordial function of scanning the

1572
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:33,390
landscapes for food friend and foe and

1573
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,999
learning to think in relationship to

1574
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:41,069
that mammoth some alternatives some of

1575
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:44,400
them actually do this in a way I think

1576
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:46,739
make the inevitable whether we wanted to

1577
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,900
a not geoengineering project that really

1578
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:50,309
actually constitutes the eco geopolitics

1579
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,609
for at least the 20th century to

1580
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:55,289
something that is either just a

1581
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:57,720
disqualified a priori as a metaphysical

1582
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:59,220
atrocity or something that will simply

1583
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,999
sort itself automatically by the

1584
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,759
invisible hand of Moore's law the former

1585
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:07,710
is animated in various guises by a kind

1586
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:10,680
of mystical primitive primitive ISM that

1587
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:13,049
is to me the Theologica of a mode of

1588
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,930
global dwelling that sees the world this

1589
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:17,819
year for us based on a fetishization of

1590
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,739
human experience of human experience

1591
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:23,400
that takes priority over the materiality

1592
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:25,410
of the emergent intelligence again it is

1593
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,480
this humanist exceptionalism that is the

1594
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:29,730
exact recipe for a patina product

1595
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,380
predicament and the accomplishment of a

1596
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:34,589
viable post answers renfa-sama

1597
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:36,359
necessitates its refusal in this

1598
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:38,579
fetishization of the experience of

1599
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:41,430
experience as as an authentic

1600
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:43,049
inferiority for one or the psychotic

1601
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,640
proposition that somehow the self is a

1602
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:46,619
stable physical entity that can be

1603
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,450
expanded exponentially by the various

1604
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:50,460
forms of computation without exploding

1605
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:53,190
into some fractal plurality as for the

1606
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,240
singularity people both of these make

1607
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,740
that geoengineering project much more

1608
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,170
and what does make it harder to

1609
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,970
recognize it for what it should be

1610
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:04,750
something that is more like molecular

1611
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:07,660
gastronomy at landscape scale a resort

1612
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:11,080
and recent and restored ecology designed

1613
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:13,930
to taste itself in new forms of richly

1614
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:19,660
spiced and imaginatively sauced mutual

1615
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:21,540
ingestion last word less I misunderstood

1616
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,710
to recommend too much of today's

1617
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:25,930
computational culture this model for the

1618
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:27,850
AI design that I'm sketching I'll end by

1619
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,650
misquoting a sentence from Adorno's

1620
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,420
minima moralia substituting the word

1621
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:35,800
smart cities for his original topic of

1622
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:37,600
escapist cinema it is not because they

1623
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,430
turn their back on washed-out existence

1624
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:41,410
that smart cities are so repugnant but

1625
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:44,110
because they do not do so energetically

1626
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:46,240
enough because they are themselves just

1627
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:49,860
as washed out because the satisfactions

1628
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:53,369
they fake coincide with the ignominious

1629
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,369
have no dream
