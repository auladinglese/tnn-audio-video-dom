1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
It's not none of this and she really will be from the

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:14,080
There's two books to read just came out the stack and dispute plan on both of which were

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
Partially put together until 7 or so we did here

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,712
So this would be suffice going into the next book

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,016
The title yet

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,368
How to deal with issues of design in philosophy and artificial intelligence is

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
Particular take on artificial intelligence not as something that

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
Exist in a kind of abstracted form of symbolic logic

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,120
Realm of pure Minds mathematics

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:42,496
But rather something that exists only in the sense it which is embodied instantiated materialized

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
Particular kinds of ways and how it is it those that instantiation

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,944
Is Koh constituted but whatever form of intelligence we might identify

13
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
Did Mike I work there

14
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,856
Some of the things that we will be working through I have listed here but no no

15
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Total promises

16
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Go

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,632
Contextualize even some of the other things we've been talking about

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,240
And thinking of a guy perhaps in relationship to the previous book on the stack

19
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
You certainly have to be understood as a certain

20
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Conversion of what we called planetary scale computation the way it works at different scales

21
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,392
Energy and mineral Source in Grid Subterranean Cloud infrastructure Urban software and service privatization

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
Interfaces drawing my documentation of the hand I directly dissolved into objects users goes over

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Outline

24
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Myself quantification or and also exploded into the arrival of Legions of sensors algorithms in

25
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Certain extent that it existed

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
This level of the user

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,432
Within the stock model but not only that really at these other five layers

28
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,832
So pitiful and design or should I say we might have to start with the city as a pen

29
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Mediary I serve it to medium

30
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
Level scale by which was supposed to work with your work up and backwards in this as well

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
It's a first-person pulmonary definition so weird

32
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Looks impossible

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Misunderstandings are the way right away

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,056
Crystal was talking to cities in this way if something is it kind of is First Source of provisional settlement organized around

35
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Some form of agriculture

36
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Provision

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
And it says initial

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Culinary geoengineering

39
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
In which ways in which we reside into as a node on a horizon

40
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
Oriental people

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
And things as they migration flow that is weird looking at the city first visited many capsulating megastructures would hold things in

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Play some second is Impreza

43
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
Is a throughput point that would accelerate or decelerate things

44
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
As they move through them

45
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Lester the particular

46
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
Orientation of the city's wayfinding interfaces

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
Intercity to find in this way with Prospectors mixed wrong mixing from I don't know

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Public health planning

49
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Supply chain Logistics

50
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:10,720
So far in infrastructure for living and non-living matter to consume itself

51
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
And for some forms of matter

52
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
Some vulgar to achieve and Hound something like Cynthia

53
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,936
Intelligence and even Sapient intelligence and some syrup

54
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
All of which in turn and in various ways

55
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
Where to remake the city

56
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
In their own image

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
It might take about the server account and going to buy things one of the things we've been working on his deep address projects going for what I'm looking at the

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,136
Theoretical address will say some IPv6 which is next Generation internet addressing system

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
What's 128 bit string

60
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
DC Universe we never run out of ipv4 addresses this

61
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Internet on now which is a theoretical 16-bit string

62
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
Impossible addresses

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
128 strings for the back of the

64
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,456
Envelope calculation how to works that works out to something like 10 to the 23

65
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Addresses

66
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Per person

67
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Text request

68
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,440
Level of the granularity by which something like a ubiquitous computing

69
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
Might actually operate

70
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Far below and above

71
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
The kind of attitude marantika metric sing that dark

72
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Conventional internet-of-things discourse work

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,519
So we're interested in this question about how it is it synthetic and augmented intelligence by operator the urban scale

74
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
At that level of granularity in all the way on not just the things that appear to us in the scaling which were used to

75
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Addressing a man being a good wife

76
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
Also will say just the purposes of this conjunction of some discussions what we mean exactly by artificial intelligence

77
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Persuade some

78
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
Misinterpretations we would we Define or would propose a version of intelligence in this way to find this as a

79
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,263
Is the president the way that matter organizes itself into some form of durable complexity

80
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
The special form of that complexity being the city

81
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
I got settled accumulation of betrayal intelligence both human and

82
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Until

83
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,319
As AI becomes more sophisticated what does it its own design project

84
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
What should it be

85
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Till we see in the one-handed episode of weight of a new anime matter to the skill and also me to dissolve

86
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Constructed into

87
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
Intimate Turnberry scales in various ways

88
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
The same thing

89
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
If we make some distinctions then between robotics on the one hand programmable matter on the other hand

90
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Culinary materialism on the third hand

91
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
Tangible media on the fourth hand

92
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
So is to bring them together backing

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Icai

94
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Not as something something

95
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Might happen

96
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Future

97
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
The thing that happens after

98
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Some great Messianic moment but is

99
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Something that we see all around us all the time

100
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Terms of a net in the form of an in terms of a kind of synthetic reason that we are always

101
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
We are in the process of Designing and designating

102
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
In which pitch

103
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
Becomes too in its own way contribute to the formulation of our own designation

104
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Of ourselves

105
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
End of it

106
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Intern

107
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,879
We also see it in it what philosophy of Mind was the other mind problem

108
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
That we might

109
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Communicate

110
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
Identifying be identified by that intelligence

111
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,631
One with which we can only share very at least very partial

112
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
World

113
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,495
Just don't we're just not invited in the world in the same way we do

114
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
The terms of those communicator

115
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
Sensory questions

116
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Sweeping

117
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Lamb salerosa Clark's 2001

118
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Communication

119
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,415
I said we try to Cai not in terms of how we think that we stink

120
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Image of ourselves

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
Virtual or artificial human cognition

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Only

123
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,007
But as something that has a way in which matter thinks and embodies another spot in a larger

124
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Shared continuum

125
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
Of material intelligence up which our own accomplishments of sapience alright

126
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Particularly

127
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Are one particular form genre

128
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,927
Right and social situation these than once more bringing these together into something like a common frame with assertive

129
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
Projecting some way across

130
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
Stock thesis which proposes

131
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
Own way of particular kind of

132
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Design model for

133
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
Political geography term to the question of planetary scale

134
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Mutation

135
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,079
Subway sandwiches of starting with the technology working from the inside out to the governance towards the questions of sovereign chain-smoking cell

136
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Where we want to locate

137
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
The AI would locate to AI locate us

138
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
Any different skills is not all the same

139
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
We want to hold them apart in a certain

140
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
Note to the design question so quickly begin to sort of at its beginning with some disclaimers were talking about the rise and says no

141
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Network Platforms in a physical world

142
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
And services geared towards an it in towards as we wanted differentiate this from certain kind of conventional smart cities discourse it

143
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
See the rise of those in terms of Justice

144
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,567
Prosaic forms of consumption in marketing pedestrian flow optimization

145
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
I'm not I hope talking about son of hybrid of The Truman Show Alpha bills of the soixante smartcat

146
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Controlling production variations this is not really what interest to me

147
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
It's not about the way in which these Technologies my

148
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Amplify or optimize

149
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,303
He's going to dog sit relation to the world with the way in which that they would crack open other

150
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Other

151
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
Again to jump I didn't we would ask then after something like intelligent how is it that in this conjunction of computer

152
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
Location of an algorithmic mechanism of computation becomes a kind of solvent

153
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,063
Are the particular form of algorithmic Reason in various kinds of matter we take it for example the computation was to

154
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Discovered more than it was invented

155
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
And at the algorithmic Jenna two processes that we might find our intrinsic to The Wider unfolding

156
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
The world

157
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
Today's meteor computational appliances

158
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
I'm nowhere near as sophisticated and efficient as those that proceed

159
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Homosapien

160
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
We take it the computations one of the ways that matter whatever format to use a television series procedural abstraction that we make tap in

161
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
To Wrangle

162
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
On some kind of provisional level one way or another

163
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
And as such Sapient brain tissue is one kind of matter that has achieved intelligence insert

164
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,023
Both some of which both clearly are and other clearly not

165
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Computational in any

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Conventional center

167
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
At the largest can we take it that the solute that's solution dissolution of synthetic computation software

168
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
In other words into the urban fabric

169
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
Provides for a landscape of inorganic forms to sort of distributed intelligence because it

170
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
Provide those things with the capacity for themselves

171
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
For abstraction

172
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
I'll talk a bit about

173
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
In a month

174
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
We see intelligent in this way as a

175
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Form of something that accomplishes abstraction

176
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Computation that is

177
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Intelligent and computation then it's a kind of

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
Mechanism of

179
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
Attraction how matter abstraction

180
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
This principle should account for two

181
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
Related but different understandings one would recognize as I say that intelligence and

182
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
College for that matter

183
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,463
Is always distributed among multiple positions and forms of life both similar and dissimilar to one another

184
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:45,119
That no single neuroanatomical disposition as a privilege Monopoly on how to think

185
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Intelligent

186
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,055
What might qualify as general intelligence is not duty-bound to BC's or file

187
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
In his capacity for abstract

188
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
We might say no ways of thinking of it in terms of the ability of any organism however primitive

189
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,575
To map the surroundings is this function

190
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Particularly in relationship

191
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
To the basic terms

192
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
A friend food

193
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Workflow

194
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,815
This is a from primordial a distraction from which we do not graduate

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
So much as we learn to develop

196
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Into something like a more formal

197
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
Reason and its local

198
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,239
Human

199
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Variation

200
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Protozoa

201
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,247
Silly and figuring out what's on non going on around at this is basic kind of mapping is this

202
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
I think the primordial formula

203
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,623
Mapping function of attraction

204
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
Is not been through an early stage through which things pass on their way to more complex forms of intelligence gets rather Jen

205
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
General principle of that complexification

206
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,727
As I say it like the protozoan the Cilia feeling about the weather out there

207
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,567
Or like humans looking and tasting and imagining patterns

208
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Today's high or sometimes augmented by various Technologies machine cognition sensation in Vision that allowed them

209
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
I want to see incense the world out there

210
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,183
I do abstract forms of mechanically embodied intelligence both deliberately program for them and

211
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Emerging unexpectedly

212
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
DeSoto

213
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Emergent particular

214
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
Form of a certain kind of distribution of the sensible if you like

215
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
Shipping certain kinds of

216
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
Pinterest humor

217
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Jakarta merleau-ponty if you like back again I want to go to think of these really up to the rest of the talk to if I discuss with you some of these

218
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
First

219
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
A kind of thinking

220
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,671
First will discuss with her challenge of conventional touring test models humanistic models of thought that would that would

221
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,767
Measure them for their epistemological and practical dangers

222
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:56,447
From the deep into structure of their effects looked to be today gather under the name of a on will shift done or what

223
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Counselors thinking but what counts is Arkansas

224
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Your name is Will

225
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
Will try to evade the presumption that when will identify and recognize the threshold of an artificial intelligence to the

226
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Said that it's recognizable similar to our own

227
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
Second Skin

228
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,439
Epidermal media synthetic skin in the design convergence of natural sensation and machine sensing

229
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,607
For animal skins like around but also put Riven skins and surface is an interface isn't implications of this for what

230
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
We may have one called rolling

231
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
And lastly Machine Vision

232
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Camouflage

233
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
The inverse uncanny valley

234
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Artificially intelligent paranoia

235
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
And I'm a female

236
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
First

237
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Thinking

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Carini's you know

239
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
Trinis you know proposed his test as a variation on the popular parlor game the imitation game in which two hidden contest

240
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
He woman

241
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Play hooray

242
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
And a man player be hard to convince a third player that he or she is a woman

243
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
By the written responses to Leading question

244
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
To win one of the players must

245
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
Convincingly be who they really are whereas the other must try to pass

246
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
As another gender

247
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,599
Entering sasak 9050 would you rather than centimeters or whatever computer took the place of player a

248
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
Is really suggesting it was just a waste of computer take a picture of a person to try to suggest they are vacuuming but they would try to pretend to be

249
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Woman

250
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:33,215
Literal reading with the mathematician Turing his health also has a pass

251
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
In his case is a straight man in society to criminalize homosexuality and upon the discovery that he was not what he appeared to be

252
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
He was forced to undergo horrific medical experiments

253
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Treatments

254
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
Known as chemical castration

255
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
How to make the physical and emotional pain is too great and he committed suicide

256
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
The episode being

257
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,327
Grotesque tribute to a man whose recent contribution to defeating Hitler's military was still estate Secret

258
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Turing suicide was only recently given up

259
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
Posthumous pardon but tens of thousands of other

260
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
British man sentence under similar laws

261
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Up to date have not

262
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
One notes I think I kind of sour ironic correspondence between asking an AI to pass that

263
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Testing order qualifies intelligent

264
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Cast of the human intelligence

265
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
Return Zone need to hide his own

266
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
I have a sexuality to pass is a straight man

267
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,351
The demands of both blocks are unnecessary and profoundly unfair and it's for all passing

268
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
The performance is success

269
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
Orfalea reveals more about the audience

270
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
In about the

271
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:45,919
In other in other places of some infections policing the imitation game is a matter of life and death

272
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,807
Photos of Ridley Scott's film version of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Blade Runner

273
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,159
It's okay good novel hinges on the voight-kampff empathy test

274
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
What you differentiate

275
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Humans from Africa

276
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,607
In this narrative replicants are throttled in two important ways first base fire at the Disco

277
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,447
A few years and two they have ostensibly a rather diminished capacity

278
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
For empathy

279
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,615
Decker the Harrison Ford character must retire a group of rogue replicants

280
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
But first you must find them and in this world

281
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Turing test thresholds

282
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Are weaponized

283
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Left replicant pass as humans and trespass the on their station

284
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,743
By the Stones conclusion Deckard poo himself may or may not be a replicant

285
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Develops

286
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,399
A certain empathy we might say for the replicants own desire for quote

287
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
More life

288
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
And arguably they to at least Roy Batty Rutger Hauer

289
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
Characters seem to have empathy for deckard's own dilemma

290
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
His dilemma and hours

291
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Is that in order to enforce the gap between the human and the II defined by empathy or lack thereof

292
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
Deckard must suppress the empathy that supposedly makes him

293
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Uniquely

294
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Human

295
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,935
I forcing him to quash his own identification with the replicants that supposedly cannot have empathy and Rich

296
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
Turn the principle of differentiation requires its own violation

297
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
In order to maintain itself

298
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:25,759
Far better icing to examine in terms of thinking about how this

299
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
Salmon identification and the identification of production of the aspect of empathy

300
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
Works from our side of the conversation

301
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
Paro the baby robot seal

302
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
It's clearly much easier to make a robot

303
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,935
Did human believes to have emotion

304
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
And for which human intern may have emotion

305
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Positive or negative entities to make a robot that actually has those ammo

306
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
The human may feel love or hate or comfort from the area but if he or she is reading choose not

307
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Detecting feelings

308
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:04,927
What seems like empathy is really a one-way projection mistaken for recognition

309
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Like the Turing test itself

310
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,071
And not based on any Mutual solidarity

311
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,727
Wheels the wish to define the very existence of a i in relationship

312
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
To its ability to mimic

313
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
How humans think that humans think

314
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,151
Will this be look back on as some weird form of species

315
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
Perhaps may also get the Legacy this also that does this Legacy the older models of AR Easter Sunday sent this

316
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
This research down

317
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Disappointingly fruitless pass hoping to recreate human Minds from top down at the basic structure and it's just

318
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Doesn't work

319
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,423
Stuart Russell and Peter norvig remind us in the essential AI textbook

320
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Biomorphic imitation

321
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Is not

322
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,079
How we design complex technology

323
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Airplanes don't fly like birds

324
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
And we surely don't try to convince

325
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
Try to trick Birds into thinking the airplanes are birds in order to test whether these planes really are flying machine

326
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
So why do we do this for AI

327
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,071
Today the vast majority of

328
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:21,727
Serious core AI research is not focus on the Turing test is anything like essential cratering if he says other than

329
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,055
Hair human artificial hugs interaction research

330
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,687
As a question was General popular discourse about the tests

331
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,039
Versions of it's been sent the anthropocentrism thereof hold such

332
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
Still such conceptual important

333
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,743
Like the animals to talk like teenagers in a Disney movie other minds are conceivable mostly by way

334
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Apura ventriloquism

335
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:52,959
Should a I arrived it will not be human-like unless we insist that it pretend to be so

336
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,823
Because one assumes the idea that intelligence could be both real

337
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:03,455
And inhuman at the same time as somehow morally or psychologically intolerable

338
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,807
Instead of nurturing is bigotry we would do better to allow that in our universe

339
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Thinking

340
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
Is a much more diverse even alien

341
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Phenomenon that our own pictures with case

342
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
That's the real philosophical issues and lessen the delay I will have less to do with humans teaching machine how to

343
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Teaching humans

344
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
Fuller into a range of what thinking

345
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Is

346
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Can be

347
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Now

348
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
In addition to the

349
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
Demystification expansion of thinking in this way in the relocation of human sapiens within this expanded form

350
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
The sensory media of synthetic intelligence may also contribute to a certain kind of undermining of

351
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Certain forms of adorable

352
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,631
Conti and sort of the philosophical distinction between thinking and sense

353
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,055
I want a home in a bit on the ways in which that kind of cartographic abstraction nothing without their

354
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
Can infect also be dermal

355
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
Related to skin

356
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,271
It occupies an agitate skins human skins building skins any skin

357
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
And how this does so also for the purposes of methane

358
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Until I touch briefly on

359
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Extending what

360
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,560
Skin based media epic start an epidermal media can be

361
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,632
Humans from we recognize that well

362
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,472
In the late nineteenth Century Cinema and photography allowed

363
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
Ford Apostle to compose and to see

364
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
Sort of images we had never seen before

365
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
Montage slow motion double exposure

366
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,784
Synthetic and recorded sound for auditory senses

367
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Our largest sensory organ

368
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,000
However quite obviously today not develop nearly as diverse forms of sophisticated

369
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,376
For the article cut short tactility were feeling on foreskin base Medias we have for vision

370
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
And hearing

371
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Clothing are you least one way that we have leap frog genetic Evolution to augment skin

372
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,688
Faster faster than evolving for blubber into engineer school buses

373
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,856
So part of the research that working will try to research engagement UC San Diego

374
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:24,256
Geopolitics in collaboration with our department Emanuel engineering bioengineering is this is some exploratory research and

375
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
How old is

376
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Let's say they presume

377
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:29,632
Space of difference between natural selection on the one hand

378
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
A machine sensing on the other

379
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
Is a lighted by certain technologies that operate in and on the skin and at the scale of are dermal and F

380
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
Ectodermal somatosensory system

381
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
Mechanoreceptors thermoreceptors and so forth and some kind of

382
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,904
Triple o word game by which nucleus machines are bequeath with panpsychic capacities for oven

383
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
Tuition has sex rather I referred you Real Deal Technologies by which biological and non-biological physicochemical

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,400
Are literally interwoven can edit the scale on sensitive skin

385
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,056
Artificial Skins are also among one of the four areas groups of

386
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,688
Design research more generally in this regard before examples long funded Research into

387
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
Advanced Prosthetics

388
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,296
Concurrently wanted to research tracks

389
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,344
Focuses on providing

390
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,488
Synthetic tactile sensation on Virtual fingertips that might go in the end of those pathetic

391
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
Look like she wearing them Steel

392
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,816
Using the way to feel it

393
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:37,216
And other kinds of dermal surfaces of for the kwikpen able alcapurria extensions for the wear

394
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
In other words I say another lapse wasn't near us when can find varieties of epidermal micro electronics at all

395
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
Augment the living skins capacities for sensing internal extra

396
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,248
Internal or external

397
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
Next Roadies

398
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
Nanoscale chemistry Cooks of inks

399
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,232
That react to the presence of ambient Trace elements of whatever particles their tune to react with

400
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Kentucky signing

401
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:08,448
Chemical sensitivity at or near the atomic level in this case and the registration of those as a transmissible infer

402
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,776
Formation with dermal and epidermal microelectronics at largest scales

403
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,640
We can conceive really of a grilled mediatisation of Sensei

404
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Surfaces

405
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,552
Together these Technologies suggest something like a skin base microstack

406
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,672
Price of biological and chemical and mechanical sensing and processing in various combinations

407
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
As an emerging formulation of wearable Computing here also including biochemical reactions

408
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,960
Did I say animal sensation machine sensing into a kind of composite surficial media

409
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,360
This platform for haptic interfaces at auction motion division it's terms of

410
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Interaction

411
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,992
Maybe below or above normal perceptual scales

412
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:58,368
It may involve autonomic nervous reactions as much as if not more than the relatively blood gestures

413
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Hands and stones

414
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:07,328
Trace and delete these dermal-epidermal media both ones we have the ones we're in the ones that we

415
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Anticipate

416
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:14,240
Make it possible to sense things about the external World other that our skin otherwise is not able to register

417
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,848
Particulate matter sensor the skills part 4

418
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
PH balance in your sweat

419
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
But the longer-term and really more interesting

420
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Design Horizon for skin basement

421
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
I want to do it allow bodies

422
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,160
Novel and unnatural form to touch sensation

423
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
We have perhaps never experienced

424
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
Pleasure in pain or on the menu but more

425
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
Early in experimental media and Renovations with with artificial Visions insights and South

426
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,432
Also perhaps is Molecular Gastronomy in the rebuilding of food from first principles on up

427
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,992
And if we include taste

428
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
Is it particularly Nuance going to touch

429
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,344
Which of course it is

430
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Then

431
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,720
Weather today novel tastes are models for New Sensation

432
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,888
The same holds true I was hoping to argue for the redesign of the surfaces of the city

433
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Its skin

434
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Urban interfaces are also sensory mechanisms sometimes their binary gateways that allow or prohibit admission

435
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,688
Other times there are reactive skins that sense threshold events

436
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
My reaction to light sound and touch

437
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Debian Trace elements

438
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,904
And as we Meander the city these interfaces are also our habitat

439
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,696
We dwell within them

440
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
But they are dwelling as well

441
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,144
They sent us as their world and we are their habitats as much as they are ours

442
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:51,008
We are organisms living inside of them just as they are inside of us

443
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:57,152
Ubiquitous Computing Adam in the City skins and surfaces of interfaces

444
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,712
We see is something like urbanism as

445
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Necessary ism

446
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
What nasty parasitism

447
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,440
From touching

448
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
To see it

449
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,400
But shipping is line of inquiry up to the servants kill this way what we take to be the artificially mediated

450
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,704
Surface includes things that are

451
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
Analogous to skin

452
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,104
But we sure but we would also those things we would today refer to colloquially

453
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
As a kind of machine

454
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Vision protocol

455
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,784
Vision has evolved independently many times

456
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,392
Evolutionary history and arguably in the past two decades or so it has a vault again

457
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
This time not for cuttlefish or rattlesnakes but for Network CCD sensors and algorithmic armatures

458
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Processing what is sensed into differentiating

459
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Differentiating and motivated

460
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Cut recognition in cognition

461
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
Quote unquote visual sensors responding to light

462
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
Often but not always shaped like Cameron

463
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Are one kind of design surface

464
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,504
Capable of synthetic sensation

465
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
And computational interpretation

466
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
Put in the wider Urban landscape they to commingle with networks of other surficial sensors responding to

467
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Motion and pressure and heat and ambient air quality so poor

468
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,936
Until I get to the extended epistemological and something convenient we call these very soon Machine Vision

469
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,008
Missing hearing machine skin but of course any real correspondence

470
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
To and from the mammalian sensory apparatus

471
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
Amelia allegory

472
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,712
The AI City maybe inviting itself but it's also a few times not as weak

473
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
Aspen media technology that links it to

474
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
But we pieced together answer tonight until particular question envision

475
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Ford light

476
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
You might say that when information is scarce

477
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
Then copying something

478
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
Is the work of the mechanical image

479
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
However

480
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
When information is abundant

481
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Especially when it's over London

482
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,104
Then seeing the original

483
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,920
Picking a pattern out of the background

484
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,224
This is the work of Machine Vision

485
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,648
Quick-thinking animals seeing and making things is easy but making copies of what it's insane and made it hard

486
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,208
But machines on the other hand making copies

487
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Is a way of seeing

488
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Is much easier than thinking

489
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Warcraft is a kind of thinking

490
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,776
And in the very history of the multiple and as I say independent evolutionary careers division

491
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Various photoreceptor cells found across

492
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,408
Viola may have evolved many different kinds of chemoreceptors

493
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,760
Most likely well in advance of anything we might recognize each other

494
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,832
Polyflex brain like information processing order

495
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Further we could say that

496
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
Photosynthesis is also

497
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,024
In the chemical response to light

498
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,120
And so in the broadest sense it to could be considered as it kind of

499
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,656
Vision Without images

500
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
Within the atom allien Vision image making Nexus

501
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
The one that we

502
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
Primarily human

503
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,040
Likely that's from the beginning to the end of the hall of fame

504
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
The total quantity of images that humans are produced

505
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
Cave walls to FaceTime

506
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Measures

507
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
Per year

508
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,096
Total pounds of images total terabytes in information so far

509
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
Continues to increase

510
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Exponentially

511
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,288
Now with digital imaging machines and everyone's pocket

512
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,616
The rawsome of total images produced

513
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,944
Some days until your 2005-2008

514
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,528
Maybe more than all of those produced

515
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Up to that moment

516
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,440
Depends of course in how you define quantify an image

517
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
But

518
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,584
But both of them even called mechanical reproducing reproducibility is certainly allowed

519
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Images to proliferate far beyond the means

520
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
If You Can Craft

521
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,776
Further today many images are made for No One

522
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
But this does not mean that their function was

523
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,456
They're made by in for machines that see the world differently than we do

524
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:20,320
Those machines don't have eyeballs are rods and cones or visual cortex but they do have sensors

525
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,648
The detect light and motion inform and heat and color

526
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
In other ways

527
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
And Saturdays at the industrial scale processing of that data that has been cleaned by scanning the light spectrum in Sun

528
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
Urban scale

529
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,496
Treat your family can millimeter scale quality control along assembly lines

530
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
Represents a significant fraction of all of the work that the world does the image itself for the purpose

531
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
Laws governing Human Society

532
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
The end of the day

533
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
Let me see me find them

534
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,064
I take more selfies than cells do

535
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
However the function of representation

536
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
At work here is probably rather differ

537
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
The quote on quote image

538
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
May likely remain

539
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Data

540
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,424
Is never rear-ender to look like a picture

541
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Because there's no need

542
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
An algorithm program to discern a particular pattern or normally can see it directly in the date itself

543
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
It doesn't necessarily need for that day to be projected

544
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,784
Is it for a mammal and then reason and reinterpreted back into

545
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
Code like any

546
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,392
Like like any algorithmic scanning and sorting of a

547
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
Any large dataset the fact

548
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
That the original source

549
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Was or is

550
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Visual

551
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Is not so critical

552
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,680
So again like plants do machines also possess a kind of

553
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Vision Without images

554
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
Or at least an image kind of damage with that suggested very different form of abstraction Twitter very different

555
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
Kind of Corporal experience

556
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
An abstraction the space on chemical or informational pattern finding as as that cartographic simulation of it

557
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
Or as that experience itself

558
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Perhaps

559
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,000
Surprising to some apps not to others

560
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
Identity

561
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,888
Function of machinic images today and other abstractions

562
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
Both animal and algorithm

563
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Is it many cases if not actually predominantly to determine

564
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,848
The veracity and originality

565
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
What does images supposedly represent

566
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,200
For example

567
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,040
Some of the shades printed on dollar bills or bureaus

568
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,416
Are there for humans to differentiate the value of one token from another

569
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
Far more are Ford Machine Vision counterfeit detection to verify that this is a real dollar

570
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,960
Piece of paper is full of machines that happened to look like pictures

571
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
It is an image as machine

572
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
Or a surveillance cannabis City make pick out one face one body from thousands of motions looking for the one

573
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
True Target

574
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,672
Elsewhere we insert tiny Camera Pro into great paintings for to verify that they are Originals

575
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,976
This is often required by Insurance Company

576
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Stacking purchases

577
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,888
Online capture software shows us an image and then in a quick

578
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:19,008
Conversion of the Turing test analyzes how the human user interpreted to determine if they are in fact

579
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
A real person

580
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
So we can clue perhaps that venue means assurances that mechanical reproduction would undermine the aura

581
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
The original

582
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,368
Is true when for example we compare a painting with a postcard of a painting

583
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,976
However Machine Vision and images as machines

584
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Put to work to ensure

585
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
O'rielly Collision

586
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
They're fighting on fakes

587
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,424
True identity unbroken version

588
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,496
Normal Target certified Real Deals

589
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:57,152
Until kind of revolution is made back around as the image is more fully teknologize

590
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
As it becomes itself a machine and some k

591
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Then benyamin's historical Ark from the pre-mechanical original to Mechanical copy is incomplete without another curve

592
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Leaving now

593
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
To what

594
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Machine Aquatics

595
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Still

596
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
If we if we if cities are always in there some way about vision

597
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
Sunday great again

598
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Disappeared

599
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
As well

600
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,568
We think of this in terms of how we see it

601
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Which is fine

602
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
Or see each other through it

603
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
Supply

604
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,736
But you also think of it in terms of how it sees on its own car

605
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
The machine visual subject

606
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:43,488
What sport is not something that's that possesses necessarily human-like or human-level perceptual anesthetic

607
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Capacities

608
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
Discernment of connoisseurship

609
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,960
But rather something that is interesting because it does not possess those things

610
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
And yet can see us

611
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Recognizes

612
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
And Noah's regardless

613
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
And that's

614
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Weird enough

615
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,016
So there's the question of the white-haired how the world looks as a screen and another

616
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
More important I think it's how we look as objects of perception from the position of machines with weave

617
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Which we

618
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
Kolacky pie

619
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
That world

620
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:21,632
Seeing ourselves Through The Eyes of this machine and other who does not

621
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,216
Cannot have an active sense of Aesthetics is it kind of

622
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Disenchantment

623
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
We are just stuff

624
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
In the world for distributed metric machine cognition to look at and to make sense of our own sapience is real

625
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
And unique

626
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,600
But as we are things to observe that just happened to the Sapient

627
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
This doesn't really matter

628
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Two machines

629
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:51,840
Distance from Shamrock I think it's more than just like hearing the sound of the record this recorded sound of your voice

630
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
Possibly be me

631
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,728
It's potentially the clearing away of a more closely guarded

632
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Illusion

633
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:05,920
Uncomfortable recognition in the machines mirror the kind of perhaps reverse uncanny valley

634
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
Instead of being creeped out that has slightly in human the creature in the image appears were creeped out at Hell on human weave

635
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
We ourselves look

636
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Through the creatures eyes

637
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Politics of this are also a bit

638
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,240
Writing a book about artificial intelligence

639
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
I found some ways I can expect it

640
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,872
In many ways fully impossible to separate

641
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248
The technology itself from the sometimes bizarre ideas that we have for it and about it

642
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
Reason fascinated by how Technologies are not only anthropomorphised

643
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,208
Because Summer considered menacing and others amazing and some both at once

644
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,352
The way in which part of the system part of the genealogy that we might take me out at least through

645
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
The Towson the influencing machine

646
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
About the ways in which this

647
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
This apparatus just the younger understanding

648
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Take on a condom

649
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Psychiatric significance

650
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Whether the aliens are reading your thoughts through radio waves in dental implants or Google is reading your thoughts to the email

651
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:17,856
The Borderlands between schizophrenia and sensible vigilance

652
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
Delusion and deductions are

653
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Disputed territory

654
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
Perhaps it comes down to a level of discomfort not just with how some people see technology but we have some people think Tech

655
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Nology see them

656
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
The occult artifacts of planetary scale computation are a cracked mirror and reflection

657
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
Scene there are given to

658
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,944
Medicann and dualistic and sometimes even bipolar

659
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
Political psychiatric

660
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Imaginary

661
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
For example deepdream

662
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
Last summer was here we had to study dreams this get these are they self tell you about these are the moments images of research and release

663
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Sometimes this summer

664
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,632
Before Franco Berardi and I were having breakfast as well he and I should be done for

665
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,496
We don't usually think about Google in the same ways let's say

666
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
But we were both totally amazed

667
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
Ongoing conversations about this really read these represent

668
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,992
A new kind of image we haven't seen before it's so he's such a long time

669
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,392
Basically

670
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Every newspaper

671
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
What's the project undertaken by Google research where you insensitive

672
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
Object recognition algorithm to analyze large data sets and look for particular things

673
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Photo app Note

674
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:42,080
Which which face you are that's a horse or dog dressed up as well they're interested in the weather like

675
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
How did what kind of feedback loops could this order provide what happens if it tries to see something that's not there but you force it to

676
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,832
See it again or use you asking to see it so often says well this is kind of what this done

677
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,744
In the simplest of explanation that the process is kind of simple find edges function like you might learn Photoshop where you should have filled

678
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,352
2D image to should make the edges everything fit more what it is in relationship to things around it

679
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
You didn't ask me to look for the thing but it's looking for

680
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
And then you do this again

681
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
And then you could do it again and then again and you feed this back through the system over and over and over and over and over again and it starts to actually

682
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,664
Depressing

683
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,992
Find things that is looking for that aren't actually there

684
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Kind of

685
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
AI

686
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Hallucination

687
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
If you like

688
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,000
Now there's a bunch of websites you can go to even take your own vacation photos and upload them and have them deep dream of find

689
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
If you like

690
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,376
Food is horrible to do this as well

691
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
P**** solo

692
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
Not recommended

693
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
The images I think a remarkable enough on their own irrespective of their

694
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,152
Providence but once the viewer I think makes the

695
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:55,552
Partial and crystals partial empathetic transference into the other mind of the speaker recognition algorithm in

696
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
It's way of seeing some

697
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,440
The effects of trying on a new motor perception

698
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,744
Making sense of the world through those eyes

699
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
That's the real payoff

700
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,144
Even if it's an example is it to hear what kind of AI

701
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Phenia

702
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
False positive

703
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
As a quart

704
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
What is the following

705
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:23,200
Stop on this remember what is a poppy apophenia is the psychological phenomenon of false pattern recognition

706
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,528
But you see a pattern in something that's not really there

707
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208
Parody Lia is the subtype of five apathy when you see faces in things that aren't really there and receiving weather Yuma

708
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
Whether you want to or not you can say I'd Sonata face I know it's not a phase you're going to see a face it's not necessarily A

709
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Kind of

710
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Process that you can be

711
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
Disenchanted of by just by

712
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Beat Hotel

713
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:54,687
What is the schizophrenia causation causality Dynamic where you see some correspondence between things I need to do sit there must be some

714
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,271
I'm called the relationship between deceiving in general instructions

715
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
About Buffet

716
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,135
Conspiracy theories apophenia as a form of political science

717
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:12,863
What is who we are and what we do is that this kind of pattern finding even the false pattern finding is intrinsic

718
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
And necessary

719
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
QR

720
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Evolution that you are taken

721
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
We R Who We R Who can't set up junk junk without it

722
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:26,943
Think of it this way there's a character

723
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
Penfield really good novels about AI

724
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Tropical echopraxia

725
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
And in this story one of the character relays this this this

726
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
Affinia to one of the other characters

727
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,167
Is the character that argues that this false pattern recognition is hardwired

728
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Into

729
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Are Homo sapiens evolution

730
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:54,079
Except some story goes like this ten thousands of years ago two guys are hiding in the tall grass

731
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,663
Quietly looking around for both predator and prey

732
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,343
One of them see the faint but distinct anomaly in the White Delight brakes to the grass moving left to right and you recognize it

733
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
This is pattern of that of a looming

734
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,695
He runs away back to the Village

735
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
Leaving his friend

736
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
Who does not possess the pattern recognition Gene

737
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
To be eaten

738
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:21,727
The guy who ran away was able to reproduce his pattern-recognition jeans and sure his and their survival

739
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:25,055
And the guy who did not possess those jeans did Don reproduce

740
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
However

741
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
It was a third guy

742
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,687
Sitting in a similar graph perhaps the morning earlier

743
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,551
He too thought there was a tiger and got up and ran back to the safety of the village

744
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
But in this case

745
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
There was no tiger

746
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
It was all in his mind

747
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
He was not cutting

748
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,975
He was paranoid

749
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:50,143
Yep he too was able to respond reproduce and his faulty pattern recognition jeans which or perhaps actually the same thing

750
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,983
Actor pattern recognition genes were also able to reproduce

751
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,031
As well perhaps with the second guys

752
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,151
The lesson is that Evolution has greatly rewarded both positive

753
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
Successful human pattern recognition

754
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
It's also found inexplicably

755
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,319
The Bounty of that bargain

756
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,879
It is also rewarded hallucination

757
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
And error

758
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
And so

759
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
It's one thing

760
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
Caution

761
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
Paranoia

762
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
About Google

763
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
But it's but it's not as if Google's algorithms are

764
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
RR

765
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,799
Art themselves as if they are not themselves also deeply paranoid

766
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,895
After all they see psychedelic log faces in everything

767
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,599
The reason the teaching hallucinating dogs is itself not spooky its object recognition faculties

768
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,927
Are you trained doing an image dataset called imagenet

769
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
Which is based on various breeds of dogs

770
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
You can try. I'll look different you train the recognition identify the poodle and a great day and I love her all constitute dog is this

771
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,055
And so it won't therefore hallucinate dogs

772
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:06,943
Where there are none and to identify people as dogs if it's told to look at them hard enough

773
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:13,343
The spider may seem insulting but maybe it shouldn't you to call the diogenes

774
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,183
Proto cosmopolitanism is based after all in the Glorious dog like

775
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,655
Until deep dreams images are artifacts of computers hallucinations of phantom conclusions then

776
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Perhaps the conspiratorial figure cut by

777
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
Eagle Google evil Google stepfather

778
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,895
Is that same paranoid Vision turn inside out and back on

779
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
Perhaps Google the eye is it paranoid and how it sees us as some of us are and how we see it

780
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,903
It's not coincidental or surprising than yours

781
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,303
Its own pattern recognition faculties would reach the plateau and accomplishments of creative apophenia

782
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,399
Go to Seymour cray

783
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
Ways in which we have perceived some kind of homology between abnormal human psychology in various machine

784
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
Haters

785
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Intro

786
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
Is Machine Vision paranoid

787
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,479
Is our popular understanding of Machine Vision

788
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
What is Google up to

789
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,575
You are they watching you and if so who or what

790
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
I received

791
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:25,023
Is our understanding of Google's paranoid Machine Vision itself paranoid making me paranoid AI that much more

792
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
Paranoid

793
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
In a word yes

794
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,775
Is this how artificial intelligence should evolve in relation to ship to and autonomously from humans

795
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Elliot's

796
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:42,175
Where is the pattern recognition and pattern recognition human pattern recognition is any indicator

797
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Bass both unproductive

798
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
And destructive apophenia deception and delusion

799
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Then yes or no

800
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
Moving then back up

801
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
N scale to the

802
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
To aru machine sensing as a whole

803
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
At the level of the whole city

804
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,447
I'm in this redistribution of the responsible

805
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Again

806
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,567
Dai City maybe embodying itself but not as

807
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
We do

808
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,199
Commingling a diver sensor satellite and Aaron sound chemistry girls up

809
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:19,039
A landscape of sensing and thinking little species

810
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,343
Partially embodied discreetly

811
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,671
One with another and partially covering body with one another

812
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,999
As their information inputs are aggregated modeled

813
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
After the pain

814
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
In various plurality

815
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:38,495
Homo sapiens comes equipped with an extraordinary array of sensory faculties which is we

816
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,823
Discuss maybe augmented further by synthetic layers

817
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:47,711
In various ratios ranging from the sensors and trackers in our phones that we carry about like meals

818
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,319
Two more intimate media of surface of artificial images in Sight and Sound

819
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,159
Situating ourselves in this expanded field

820
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,975
Again we are both sensors and sense

821
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:06,911
On the one hand we are primary Sapien actor in the drama supervising Orchestra of sense

822
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
Technology capable of functional processing in together of certain forms of aggregate emergency College

823
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
As stars

824
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,551
On the other we're not only the subject of the scenario we are also its subject matter

825
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:31,231
The Wider Urban Landscaping synthetic Century systems is not only a platform through which we extend and extract

826
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,631
Appellate are capacities for abstraction distributed cognition it's also capable of other sorts of Attraction on its own

827
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,775
Is part of its intelligence it looks at us and registers abstraction

828
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
About

829
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
Mackenzie in the city

830
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
But nested AI Cohen bodied as the city

831
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,391
With very different sorts of organisms to population to Gino Tanish to signal morphologies

832
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
At work

833
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
And that's the

834
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
Work of abstraction

835
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Forward

836
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,423
What design more generally is not only to deploy abstract forms but to set in motion mechanisms

837
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
And programs that are capable of their own feet

838
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Other traction

839
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,591
How to calibrate how they abstract us in one another

840
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
According

841
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
In short we should imagine an AI organism of different room instead of like vondelstraat stroll

842
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,391
The field populated by intermingling but neutrally oblivious little life worth

843
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,743
Origins of the losses parable of the tick

844
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,119
The later wait laying in wait for some threshold event to come its way which point

845
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,399
It's triggers

846
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Programmed response sleeping out

847
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,471
Into its own

848
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,495
Little void

849
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:51,103
Many of our Urban sensors and their limited forms of AI

850
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Work similarly

851
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
And was similar nobility

852
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
More versatile synthetic intelligence occupy more complex on felt some more predators and prey summary

853
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,439
Rocking motion summer flowering some pollinating

854
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,303
And if we stroll along then we may be registered by them or we may be ignored

855
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,959
Maybe a primary cause of concern we may be a passing interference in an evolutionary dynamic in which we are neither

856
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
The protagonist

857
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Your target

858
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,127
And this is anyway as we might expect

859
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Actually not surprised

860
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Kino

861
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,759
Ships from top-down to bottom-up AI

862
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,575
Mark by shift of emphasis from

863
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,647
Intelligence is a formal syntax

864
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,487
To one of a specifically embodied relation to specific world

865
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
And models

866
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:46,143
Heuristic knowledge of habitat is seen as Inseparable from how an AI manipulates

867
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Is situated problem

868
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
Until we bought it with a pairing of synthetic

869
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,103
Example allows for

870
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,479
Simple artificial species to perform intelligently because they have what amounts do functionally

871
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Anybody

872
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,087
Perceptual relocation the world they can sink because they can see

873
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
D

874
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255
The implications of all of this

875
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,863
Politics geopolitics in the rest of this as I say rotten

876
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Tangled

877
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
Banal and various measures

878
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:27,359
Extension the biochemistry of climates and ecosystems to the rhetorical conventions of citizenship and sovereignty it's messy

879
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,687
Cai so we're talking about not a kind of clean and pure AI

880
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,295
Interlocking food presentation with a few

881
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Admonitions

882
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
For the general

883
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Disciplinary design

884
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
Brake for AI and for what we

885
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
My calls

886
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
Post anthropocene

887
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
It is

888
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,399
At best

889
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,495
A paradoxical accomplishment to survive a mass extinction event

890
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
The modern human species has the dubious distinction of gnarly observing and measuring mass extinction while it is happening but also

891
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,271
Doing so with the understanding that it is one pre of the trim and agents of that

892
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
It does so with the

893
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,255
Did ambivalent comfort that get that one way or another it to

894
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
Is unlikely to survive

895
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,607
The bloody edge of the anthropocene

896
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,703
So much to parks

897
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
Water rhymes

898
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,335
Simultaneously with the collapse of biodiversity

899
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
We also see

900
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:37,503
At least the trunk potential for an explosion of new quotient of species taking form through

901
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,575
Robotics and synthetic biology in artificial intelligence

902
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,927
You can't see the ladder as replacement for the former and yet

903
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
There they are

904
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,351
Because for example that the first or things in space

905
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
We're not humans

906
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,983
And the very low percentage of all or things in space have been humans

907
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
Human biology is needy

908
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Fragile

909
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,223
Is poorly suited to space travel largely because we have to bring an entire ecosystem with us

910
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,063
Oxygen to radiation filters to the microbial biome

911
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
In our testing to help us digest food

912
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,671
Currently configured

913
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Human

914
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:22,815
We cannot really believe Earth because we have to bring a miniature Earth with us

915
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
When we go

916
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:31,519
This is not true in the same way for other species which supervised comparatively easy in space such as metalloid robotics

917
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
Jackson perhaps also someday

918
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,103
Some kinds of synthetic biology

919
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
And so perhaps like the small mammals that took that fit that took over after the Cretaceous paleocene Extinction

920
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:48,415
They're just better suited to the very different punctuated equilibrium to come

921
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
They may enjoy successes that we cannot

922
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
Leaving us behind

923
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Been stranded

924
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Place

925
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
So what

926
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,775
Comes then after an anthropocene Extinction

927
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:11,199
The only thing we can know about the post and prophesying is it it's a Nira in which humans would no longer be that

928
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Dominant geologic actor

929
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
Perhaps in New Orleans species may prove to be more fit better at making the next evolutionary step than humans are until 4

930
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:25,023
R Us to quote survive we may have to become more like them and less like what we are now

931
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,167
The longer view humans roll maybe that of an enabling intermediary

932
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,215
Between early primates

933
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:38,335
And as yet to emerge phyla that blend organic and inorganic flesh

934
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
NSYNC

935
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:46,015
This is the point of convergence between robust Ai and the Deep ecology of

936
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Voluntary human

937
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Extinction

938
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
But

939
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
Instead of Disappearing however

940
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,487
We may Survive by Perforating the boundaries between animal vegetable and mineral

941
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Aztec design

942
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,863
Just as art design problem and design solution

943
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:08,031
What's the oldest age is the death of the users is a certain kind of death of a certain for humanism as any clips of ascertain

944
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Resolute human

945
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
It does so because it brings with it also the multiplication and proliferation of other forms of non-human in human

946
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
EXO human

947
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,575
Agents in subjects including

948
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,975
Robots nanometric to Landscapes kill any combination of which with which

949
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,303
We may enter into a kind of relationship as a

950
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,327
Deposit

951
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Subject

952
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:41,311
The complexities and contradictions of those Salvage in relationship to those Composites or nevertheless

953
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,615
With those causing intelligence NSAIDs after

954
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:50,527
Is this a work to dismember certain conventional distinctions between subject and school occupant and City

955
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
And so and so

956
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,671
Introduces a certain kind of a redistribution of a certain kind of

957
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,231
Agnostic universal suffrage

958
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:03,071
By which it what kind of matter can enter into that position and take on that

959
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
Cleaning a strongly

960
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
A different kind of strong

Mercurial

962
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Perspective

963
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,519
Encourage more input we anticipate

964
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
Without a doubt

965
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
But as this

966
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,383
Asterisk works itself out

967
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:22,271
As a disenchantment unfolds that it there would we went dissipate all manner of pushback

968
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,087
Against this demystified in Demonite

969
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:31,999
Natalie distaste for certain forms of quantification and preference for romantic verse for example

970
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:37,631
Put a bull work on behalf of what amounts to a pre copernican and deeply reactionary humanist exception

971
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,935
Even a human is fundamental

972
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,895
I push back as they say it's broken and perhaps is raschke rational that is certain affinity

973
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:55,295
Certain Technologies however fictitious or bizarre that's Kennedy's maybe they're thought to embody the essence of a kind of cry

974
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
Directions to order one of these days

975
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
Food

976
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,207
Extend its influence of technology to Personal Mastery sex

977
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Car

978
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:12,703
Google X was beginning to work on the driver there driverless car project I want to come visit at the labs if there was a student

979
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
And mine who is not working on that

980
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:19,615
Meeting with him is until you guys must have heard a lot of different kind of strange

981
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,687
Strange ideas about what the driverless car system

982
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Going to

983
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
Amount to in about what is a pushback from

984
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,063
Well

985
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
It's funny you should ask if they pull up this piece of paper with

986
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
Attention to file

987
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,023
Potential file preemptive legal notices something which is far as I can tell this

988
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,047
Completely made up

989
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
Document

990
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,143
From the group called gunownersofamerica

991
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,471
Which is an advocacy group a bit to the right of the net of the NRA

992
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
And if you remember that in United States alone roughly about 30,000 people a year are killed in car accidents butts

993
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:59,295
28000 the year of those are directly attributable to human driver error and so with driverless cars could kill

994
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,111
27000 people a year or less

995
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
They would still PA

996
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
From Shirley consequentialist view of ethical

997
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:15,167
For purposes of President putting a human behind the wheel is just

998
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
Too great of a risk

999
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,007
Unethical to put everyone else's

1000
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
That makes sense

1001
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,687
What does legal thing was with this document things that you should

1002
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
It become illegal for humans to drive a car

1003
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,879
In this way that they will see to have automobiles reclassified as ammunition

1004
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:40,767
And thereby covered by the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution which guarantees the right to bear arms in this case

1005
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
A car

1006
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Or

1007
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,847
But this way you would like maybe ended by someone in case in a 2-ton steel box careening down the asphalt trying to

1008
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,687
To prove a point about his how technology will never capture his natural Humana

1009
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
All of this is not without real risk we anticipate that this distribution of

1010
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:13,791
Apperception and Co embodiment implied by Senpai I at the urban scale wood

1011
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,983
If we are tempted in persistent shift and expand what we take to be an ethics of shelter and Encounter of negotiate

1012
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
Haitian and even

1013
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
Immunity

1014
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
And in this D

1015
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,639
Modern era form of proven anime

1016
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:35,295
May pale in comparison to the challenges of predator-prey camouflage dissimulation relationships implied by

1017
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Emergence of various

1018
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
Alien lines in urban scale

1019
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,487
Negotiating our way to a livable posting prophecy necessitates

1020
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,559
However I still argue a Fidelity to emergency

1021
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
Not to emergency

1022
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Because copernican traumas

1023
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,055
Abolish the false centrality and specialness of human thought and species being

1024
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
Are priceless

1025
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,359
Accomplishment

1026
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
The Advent of robust in human AI

1027
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:10,623
Could provide for similar disenchantments one that should enable a more reality-based understanding of ourselves

1028
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,671
Algebra situation and Fuller

1029
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:19,327
And more complex and nuanced understanding of what intelligence is what's thinking is and is not

1030
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,119
From there

1031
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,447
We can hopefully make our world with greater confidence

1032
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,263
There are models are good approximation

1033
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
Out there

1034
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Always

1035
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,735
An additional harm and did not unusual harm of the alternative to that

1036
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:43,135
Is in perpetuating a relationship to technology that has brought us to the precipice of a six

1037
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Great Extinction

1038
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,719
Arguably

1039
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
50 and throughout the scene itself is due less to technology run amok then to the human is Legacy that

1040
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,215
Who stands the world is having been given for our needs and created in our image

1041
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,031
We still see this everywhere

1042
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,895
Are Computing culture very deeply confused and so and it is so along the same line

1043
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
Vacillate between thinking technology at the transparent extension of our desires on the one hand and I'm thinking of it as a nun stop

1044
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
Stop a boil in your historical force on the other

1045
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:20,511
For the first agencies magically ours alone and for the second agencies all in the code

1046
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,839
That's gross inflation of the former is really inverted

1047
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
Back into the other

1048
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
And this is why we can't have nice

1049
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:34,335
Well known get sloppy in the world of design recently wrote killing remain nameless

1050
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,223
It's time to invert invent world war machines are subservient to the needs and wishes of humanity

1051
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
Simply dressed

1052
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
If you think so

1053
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
I invite you to Google

1054
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
Pig decapitating machine

1055
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:54,559
And then let's talk about inventing world see which machines are holy subservience

1056
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
The human race

1057
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
One wonders whether it's only from a society that one skate theological and legislative Comfort to chattel slavery

1058
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,799
This particular client could be offered

1059
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
What's up

1060
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,359
Satisfied naivete

1061
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,783
This is the sentiment this philosophy of Technology exactly that is the basic algorithm Panther the scenic route

1062
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
Time to move on

1063
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
This pretentious folklore

1064
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
Is too expensive

1065
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
And so

1066
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:32,191
Differently please to make technology serve humans and serve human needs and desires requirements appear

1067
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,495
Utterly misguided and even suicidal

1068
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,335
Staring upon the events of mass extinction

1069
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,639
We hear the drearily common refrain

1070
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,687
Variously explicit or latent

1071
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,087
That identifies called modern technology as the main culprit in conclusion that the most fundamental solution

1072
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,391
If UD technology is a planet

1073
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,439
Into rehumanize yourself

1074
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,999
One presupposes the other in various measures

1075
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
This is among the worst

1076
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
Possible

1077
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Plans

1078
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
Philosophically

1079
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
And practice

1080
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
First Stitch tragically def

1081
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,311
To the Priceless copernican trauma of the anthropogenic precipice

1082
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,663
Then our status as a dominant geologic actor is fleeting

1083
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,783
So in order to survive we would have to become somebody that it's not necessarily recognizably human

1084
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,135
And second process of a psychotic misrepresentation with humans

1085
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
And humanism

1086
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
Actually are

1087
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,023
We are the brain eating eggs with weaponized hydrogen

1088
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,375
Organizer societies according to Bronze Age poetry

1089
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,447
On human sacrifice and ritual purification

1090
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,799
Among the last projects to support

1091
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,663
Esri humanization in any sense of a direct return to historical norms

1092
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
I think the other species would agree

1093
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:53,087
The last reason why do desire

1094
01:03:55,647 --> 01:04:01,535
How do we map with a certain technological material to compensate as a theory of subjectivity against the tropes

1095
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
But with the tropes of Heroes

1096
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
Tricky

1097
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,727
Troy barely had Darwin

1098
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:16,127
To work with let alone genetics and genomics and so she probably repeating some of those terms you're probably a little bit ly

1099
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Reese the Greek

1100
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,991
Organic versus inorganic

1101
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,295
That is whether something is alive or not alive

1102
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,367
Kind of the minor is sort of a minor issue

1103
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,927
Something having or not having a carbon molecule

1104
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:36,607
Is it the same any any melting back into the inorganic instead of tonic and pull

1105
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,423
Interview over comment overwhelmed by

1106
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,287
In absorbed by matter itself may be a way of encountering and even Desiring death

1107
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Perhaps

1108
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,895
He's also in many ways a very everyday kind of occurrence

1109
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:56,575
It's not a sad Destiny to The Interlopers Indian matter and other diagram and other diagrams for that disc

1110
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
Solution of possible but anatomic

1111
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
An economic

1112
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
The human body

1113
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,303
And this Earthly landscape of matter are only the default settings

1114
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
The knot

1115
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Destiny

1116
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,983
Chemistry may drive the most radical forms of the philosophical imaginary to

1117
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
A culinary materialism

1118
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,127
Rubbing the clinamen Raw

1119
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:28,831
Until he remember algorithms For Whining evolution of vision Returns the primordial function of

1120
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
Scanning the landscape

1121
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Food

1122
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
Pho

1123
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,695
I'm going to thinking relationship to that man

1124
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,839
Some alternatives

1125
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,887
Do this anyway I think make the

1126
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
Inevitable

1127
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,567
Whether we wanted to or not geoengineering project it really actually constitutes the Eco geopolitics released at 1

1128
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,359
That is either

1129
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:58,271
Is qualified a priority as a metaphysical atrocity or something that will simply sort itself

1130
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
Automatically by the Invisible Hand of Moore's Law

1131
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
The former

1132
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:09,535
Is animated in various sizes by a kind of mystical primitive primitivism that is to me the field logic Express

1133
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,327
Russian of the mode of global

1134
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Dwelling that sees the world is here for us

1135
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,727
Based on the fetishization of Human Experience of Human Experience

1136
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:21,567
Priority over the materiality of the emergent intelligence

1137
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,687
Again it is this humanist exceptionalism that is the exact recipe for anthem

1138
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:32,063
Predicament

1139
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
In this fetishization of the experience of experience as of it as an authentic interiority for one

1140
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
For The Psychotic proposition is somehow the self is a stable physical entity that can be expanded exponentially by the fairies from

1141
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:51,519
The complications out exploding into some fractal plurality as for the singularity people

1142
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:57,663
Both of these make that geoengineering project much more difficult than what it is make it harder to recognize it for what it is

1143
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
Some of it is more like

1144
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,039
Molecular Gastronomy at landscape scale

1145
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,671
I resorted and Reese and been restored ecology designed to taste itself

1146
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,023
The new forms of Richmond spiced and imaginatively sauce

1147
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Mutual in chest

1148
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,375
Last word

1149
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:24,543
Unless I misunderstood to recommend too much of today's computational cultures is model for the AI design them

1150
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,943
Sketching out on by misquoting a sentence the McDonald's minimum Aralia substituting the word smart cities for his original

1151
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,223
Topic of Escapist Cinema

1152
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,927
It is not because they turn their back on washed-out existence that smart cities are so repugnant but because they do not do so enter

1153
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
Ethically and nuts

1154
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,815
Because they are themselves just as washed out because the satisfactions they fake

1155
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,119
Coincide with the enemy of denial

1156
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,399
Dreams

1157
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Have no dreams
